"""Generate a per-entity ``THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES`` from what each entity actually links.

The file is derived from the resolved topology, never hand-written, so it stays accurate
as entities and providers change (docs/licensing.md). Under open-source Qt the client
(WASM) and the web edge are GPLv3, pure services are LGPLv3; some Qt add-ons (HTTP Server,
Network Authorization, Qt Quick 3D/Physics) are GPLv3-only and make their entity GPLv3.
Under a commercial Qt license none of the GPL terms apply.

The GPLv3-only modules are read off :data:`appmodel.LIBRARY_GPL_MODULES`, keyed by the
runtime libraries :func:`appmodel.service_libraries` gives the entity, which are the same
ones ``cmakegen`` links. A module cannot appear in one and not the other.
