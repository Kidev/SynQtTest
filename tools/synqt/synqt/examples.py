"""The example systems the CLI ships, and ``synqt new <name> --example <example>``.

An example is a whole project, not a snippet: the same `synqt.yaml`, the same entity
folders and the same QML a hand-built one has, which is why starting from one is a copy and
not a template expansion. What the copy changes is the project's name, and what it adds is
the two files a checkout of an example does not carry because the repository already has
them elsewhere (a `.gitignore` and a `.env.example`).

They are read out of the framework root, the same directory `src/` and `cmake/` come from,
so a checkout uses the examples being edited and an installed wheel uses the copy vendored
inside it (`tools/synqt/_build_backend.py` puts them there).
