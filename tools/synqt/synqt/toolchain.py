"""Resolve the pinned toolchain: the host + WebAssembly Qt kits and Emscripten.

Qt is pinned to project.qt_version and Emscripten to the version Qt selects for it. The
CLI resolves a kit already provisioned under ``synqt/toolchain/`` (via aqtinstall/emsdk),
then falls back to a system install (``/opt/Qt``, ``~/Qt``, ``QTDIR``) so a developer with
Qt already installed does not re-download it. When a kit is missing, the resolver reports
the exact aqtinstall/emsdk command that would provision it.

Everything host-shaped here is derived from the running platform, never assumed: the host
kit directory, the aqt coordinates that install it, and the system prefixes searched all
differ per operating system, and SynQt supports three (docs/desktop.md).

    These are commands copied out of ``synqt doctor`` and run, so a hint that does not

    rather than a cosmetic one. Three things were wrong here at once:

    The coordinates are the aqt ones, not the kit directory names they land in: the host
    kit's arch is per platform (``linux_gcc_64`` installs into ``gcc_64``, ``clang_64``
    into ``macos``, ``win64_msvc2022_64`` into ``msvc2022_64``), while the WebAssembly kit
    is one host-independent build published under its own ``all_os wasm`` host and target.
    Ask for the WASM kit under the desktop target instead and aqt reports that it cannot
    locate the Qt version at all, which sends you looking for the wrong problem.

    The host hint is derived, not fixed: it read ``linux desktop ... linux_gcc_64`` for
    every platform, so ``synqt doctor`` on a Mac told you to install the Linux kit.

    And both hints installed a kit that cannot build SynQt. aqt installs qtbase and
    qtdeclarative and nothing else without ``-m``, so the command printed here produced a
    Qt with no QtRemoteObjects, no QtWebSockets, no QtHttpServer and no QtNetworkAuth: it
    is followed exactly, and the build then dies at the first find_package. The module
