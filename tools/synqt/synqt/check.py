    the symptom of all three is the same as the feature working perfectly and nobody ever
    staying signed in.

    A floor that some machines do meet is reported instead of refused. Which level a machine
    reaches is a property of that machine, so the edge settles it at enrolment; what is worth
    saying at build time is which whole platforms in `targets` cannot reach the configured
    level, so raising the bar is not a silent way to turn persistence off for a third of your
