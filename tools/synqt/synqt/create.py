"""``synqt create``: the interactive front end to ``synqt new``.

Two commands rather than one flag. ``synqt new`` is the scriptable one: every answer is
a flag, it reads nothing from the terminal, and it behaves identically in a shell, in a
Makefile and in CI. ``synqt create`` asks the same questions out loud and then calls it.

They are split for a reason. A single command that prompts when it has a terminal and
silently picks defaults when it does not is two behaviors wearing one name: the CI run
takes a path nobody watched it take, and the difference only shows up in the generated
project. Here the name says which you get, and `create` refuses to run without a
terminal rather than quietly becoming `new`.

The questions are the security-relevant ones and nothing else. There is no question
about the origin model: a scaffolded project is same-origin, which is the only shape
whose session cookie is first-party (see the "Serving the client from another origin"
section of docs/project-layout-and-config.md). Offering a menu item is how someone picks
the other one without reading what it costs.
