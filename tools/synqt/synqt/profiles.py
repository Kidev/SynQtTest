"""What a build profile means, in one place.

`synqt build` takes a profile and every environment resolves it for itself, because the
right release build of a WebAssembly bundle is not the right release build of a service. A
visitor downloads the client over a network before a line of it runs, so its release is
`MinSizeRel` and the flags that matter are the ones that make it smaller. Nothing downloads
a service, so its release is `Release` and the flags that matter are the ones that make it
faster. Both strip.

Two callers need these answers: :mod:`synqt.build` configures with them, and
:mod:`synqt.presets` writes them into CMakePresets.json so a contributor driving CMake by
hand gets the same build the CLI produces. A second copy of the table would be a second
answer to what a release is, and the one that is wrong is whichever one nobody read.
