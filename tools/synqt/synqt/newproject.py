; How `synqt check` judges QML formatting when check.qml_format is on. Shipping one at all
; is the point: left to itself qmlformat searches per directory and then falls back to a
; PER-USER file (~/.config/.qmlformat.ini), so the same QML would get a different answer on
; each machine and a third in CI. `synqt check` passes this with -s, overriding the lookup,
; and skips the check entirely if this file is missing rather than guessing.
;
; Indentation, tabs, newlines and semicolons are unambiguous and qmlformat is simply right
; about them. Everything that reorders or rewrites your code is off, and each is off for a
; measured reason, not out of caution:
;
;   NormalizeOrder=false            The two ordering knobs, mutually exclusive. Normalize
;   GroupAttributesTogether=false   sorts each group alphabetically (visible, width, height
;                                   -> height, title, visible, width), pulling related
;                                   properties apart; grouping does the same reordering
;                                   without the sort, and is faithful to the conventions:
;                                   an assignment like `width: 10` is an object property
;                                   (group 5), only `property int x` is a declaration
;                                   (group 2). Both then demote an object's own state below
;                                   its logic. That reads fine on a visual Item and badly
;                                   on the two shapes SynQt actually has: a Source, whose
;                                   props ARE the contract and belong at the top, and a
;                                   client root, whose `visible/width/height` are what make
;                                   it a window at all. Neither moves the comment that
;                                   explains a property with it, so grouping strands them.
;                                   The conventions were written for scene objects; where
;                                   they fit, order by hand.
;   MaxColumnWidth=-1               No wrapping. qmlformat reflows expressions and no
;                                   setting stops it, so a limit only chooses where it goes
;                                   wrong: it breaks wherever the limit lands, between an
;                                   operand and its operator or between a call and its
;                                   argument. Unset, it instead joins a hand-wrapped
;                                   expression back onto one long line, which is at least
;                                   predictable, and a line that ends up too long is a fair
;                                   signal to name a property or extract a function.
;   ObjectsSpacing=false            Blank-line insertion, which only does anything when one
;   FunctionsSpacing=false          of the reordering knobs above is on.
;   SortImports=false               Reorders imports, and qmlformat's own help warns it can
;                                   change semantics when two modules export one name.
;
; So what is left is whitespace and semicolons: the parts with one right answer, that no
; reviewer should spend a comment on. Change any of it: it is your project's QML.
