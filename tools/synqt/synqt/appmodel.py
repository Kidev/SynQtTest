entity holds.

Nothing here emits anything. It is the shared reading of the topology that
:mod:`synqt.cmakegen` (the root ``CMakeLists.txt``), :mod:`synqt.maingen` (one
``main.cpp`` per entity) and :mod:`synqt.check` all work from, so the three can never
disagree about which file a route means, which connect points an entity owns, or which
QML the client module compiles in.

Reading is where the refusals live too, because a topology this module cannot read is
one the generator must not silently guess at: a view that escapes the client directory,
a route with nothing to show, two QML files claiming one type name.
