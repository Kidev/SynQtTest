"""Operator credentials for the monitoring console.

The monitor holds every entity's record, so a single sign-in there reveals what the whole
system has been doing. It therefore has an identity system of its own, separate from the
application's on purpose: an operator is not a user of the application, and a project's own
login provider is often the thing an operator is signing in to investigate.

What this module produces is the *stored form* of a credential: a name, an iteration count,
a random salt, and a PBKDF2-SHA256 hash. The password itself is never written anywhere, and
the stored form is not a secret in the sense a password is: it cannot be replayed, only
brute-forced, which is what the iteration count is for.

There is deliberately no `list` and no `remove`. The operator list lives in the monitor
entity's environment (`SYNQT_MONITOR_OPERATORS`), like every other credential in SynQt, and
a CLI that pretended to own that list would be a CLI that edits whatever file the deployment
happens to keep it in. `add` prints a line; where it goes is the deployment's business.
