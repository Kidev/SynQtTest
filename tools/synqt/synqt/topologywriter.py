"""Write the resolved per-entity ``topology.json`` the service runtime reads at startup.

``synqt.yaml`` is the user-facing topology; the generated service ``main.cpp`` reads a
machine form (``--topology build/<entity>/topology.json``) that ``EntityRuntime`` and
``topologyFromJson`` parse (see ``src/service/topology.{h,cpp}``). This module produces
that machine form: for every service entity it emits its slice of the topology; its mesh
credentials, its blueprint/provider/schema (so the runtime injects the right backend
helper), and every connect point it owns or consumes with a resolved mesh endpoint.

The one invariant that makes it correct: a connect point's endpoint (mutual-TLS host+port,
or a local-socket name) is resolved once, globally, so the owner listens on exactly the
address its consumers dial. Ports are assigned deterministically from the sorted
connect-point list, so the same topology always yields the same wiring.

Secrets never land here: a provider's ``password: env:DB_PASSWORD`` is passed through
verbatim (the env var *name*, not its value), and the runtime resolves it from the entity
environment. Paths are absolute so the file resolves the same whether an entity is launched
from the project root (``synqt dev``) or from its deploy directory (``synqt serve``).
