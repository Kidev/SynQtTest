"""Turn a connect point's ``export:`` block into the ``.syn`` the compiler reads.

A connect point and the shape of what crosses it are one thing, so they are written in one
place: the point's ``export:`` in ``synqt.yaml`` holds the members, and nothing names the
contract, because the point is already named.

    connect_points:
      - name: auction
        owner: edge
        consumers: [app]
        export: |
          prop string itemName
          prop int highBid
          slot placeBid(int amount)
          signal bidRejected(string reason)

What the generator wants is a file, so one is written under ``generated/`` beside the
entity's generated main: ``generated/web/edge/Auction.syn``. Its name is the point's,
capitalized, which is also the QML type the point's server file is rooted at. Nobody edits
it; editing the ``export:`` block rewrites it.
