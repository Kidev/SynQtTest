"""Everything a monitor entity is made of, written in one go.

A monitor is not one entity but three things that only work together: the entity that keeps
the history, a client that shows it, and the gate that decides who may download that client.
Scaffolding one of them and leaving the author to wire the other two would be scaffolding
the easy part; what makes a console safe is the part that is easy to leave out.

So `synqt add entity ops --type monitor` writes:

* the monitor entity, which keeps the history and serves the console on its own port;
* a console client, marked `console: true`, delivered only to an operator;
* `monitoring.entity`, which is what makes every service report to it;
* a `bundles:` block whose anonymous entry is a static sign-in page, so a visitor with no
  operator session cannot download the console at all;
* the sign-in page itself.

The console's QML is generic on purpose. It reads the framework's own `Console` contract,
whose every type is a string, a number or a bool, so the same console serves an auction, an
arena, and a system nobody has written yet. A project that adds an entity does not rebuild
it.

    The hosted editor has no scaffolder. It could not offer a monitor at all, because three
    of the four things one is made of are files rather than configuration, and a project
    downloaded with a monitor and no console is a project that cannot be finished: the CLI
    refuses to complete an entity that already exists. So the row was dimmed and the page
    told the reader to go and use the CLI.

    This is the other way of answering that, and the one that does not cost a second copy of
    anything: the scaffolder publishes what it would have written, the editor writes the
    same bytes, and `tests/test_monitoring.py` fails the build when the two stop matching.
    The functions below are the ones :func:`scaffold` itself calls, so there is one writer
    and one answer, read twice.

    The name is left as :data:`DESIGN_NAME_TOKEN` for the editor to substitute, because the
