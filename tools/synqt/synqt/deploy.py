"""The platform deployment step for the native desktop client, run only when asked.

`synqt build --client desktop` does not deploy. That is deliberate and documented
(docs/desktop.md): signing identities, entitlements, notarization and installer format are not a
framework's to choose, and a half-deployed bundle that looks finished is worse than one that says
what is missing. What the build guarantees is that the step *can* be run; on macOS that is why
the client is built as an .app bundle at all, since macdeployqt accepts nothing else.

`--deploy` is the opt-in that runs it anyway, for the case where the developer wants a
self-contained tree out of one command and will sign it themselves afterwards. It never signs:
an unsigned .app is still Gatekeeper-blocked, so pretending otherwise would recreate exactly the
"looks finished" failure the default position exists to avoid.
