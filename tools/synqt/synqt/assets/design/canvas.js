// The drawing: one design document turned into the SVG the page shows.
//
// The same picture the guide's front page uses, because it is the same system: a disc with a
// glyph per entity, and per link a dashed line from the owner to each consumer carrying a
// lock and the contract the two share. What a reader recognises from the drawing there they
// can point at here.
//
// Three things the drawing states rather than leaves to be worked out, because getting any
// of them wrong is how a system ends up insecure:
//
// * which side of the wire an entity is on, drawn as the box it sits in. One box is the
//   browser, one is the entity facing the internet, and one is the mesh nothing outside can
//   reach. Dragging a database into the middle box does not make it reachable; the boxes are
//   drawn from what each entity *is*, so an entity that has wandered out of its box is the
//   drawing telling you the arrangement no longer reads left to right.
// * who owns what, drawn as a filled cap at the owner's end of every link and an arrowhead
//   at the consumer's. The owner is the entity that decides; a consumer only ever asks.
// * what each entity's QML is called, written under its name, because that is the file
//   somebody opens next.
//
// Everything is rebuilt from the document on every change rather than patched in place. A
// mesh is tens of nodes, not thousands, and a drawing that is a function of the document
// cannot fall out of step with it.
