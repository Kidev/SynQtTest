// what it reaches for in another entity.
//
// A project is made of three kinds of text and the pane shows all three, so all three are
// coloured here. Only QML is read for meaning, because only QML has any: `synqt infer` does
// that same reading in Python, over the same two questions, and this is it brought to the
// page, because the copy on synqt.org has no CLI behind it and the editor has to behave the
// same in both places.
//
// It is deliberately a reader of declarations, not a parser of QML. A declaration is a line;
// everything below the line is the author's and is never interpreted, never rewritten and
// never held against them. That is what makes it safe to run on every keystroke.
//
// Pure functions over text, no DOM, so the suite can hand them a file with node and compare
// what came back against what `synqt infer` says about the same file.

// What a QML word is, once the line it sits on is known. Only used to paint: nothing here
// decides anything, so a word this gets wrong is a colour, never a member.
