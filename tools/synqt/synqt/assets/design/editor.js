// The file pane's editor.
//
// It used to be two layers sharing a box: a transparent textarea holding the caret, and a
// coloured copy of the same text painted behind it. That works until it does not, and the
// list of what it could never do is the list of what anybody expects of a pane they type code
// into -- line numbers, a matched bracket, a selection that is visible, an undo of its own.
// Every one of those was a layer with nothing to build it on.
//
// This is CodeMirror doing that job; vendor/README.md is what is vendored and how. The
// colouring is still ours: `runsFor` in source.js is the one description of what QML, YAML,
// SQL and a contract look like, and this turns its runs into decorations. Nothing about the
// syntax is written twice, so the pane and the canvas cannot drift apart -- the members
// written along a link and the file they are declared in are coloured by one reader.

// The pane, styled.
//
// A CodeMirror theme and not rules in editor.css, which is where this started and where it
// did not work. The base theme the library ships with is two and three classes deep
// (a generated class of its own, then `.cm-gutters`; a generated class, `.cm-lineNumbers` and
// `.cm-gutterElement`), and a plain `.cm-gutters` in a stylesheet loses to every one of them. That was not a detail of the gutter: the pane had been wearing
// CodeMirror's *light* base theme on a dark page, which is why the number of the line the
// caret was on sat invisible on a pale blue block, and why the selection and the caret were
// the library's colours rather than the page's. A theme is the mechanism the library provides
// for this and it outranks the base theme by construction, so nothing here has to out-guess a
// specificity.
//
// The values are the page's own custom properties. They cross into the shadow root and are
// resolved where they are used, so this follows the reader's light or dark setting with no
// rebuild -- which is the one thing a theme written in JavaScript would otherwise cost.
