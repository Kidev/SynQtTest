// The file pane's editor.
//
// It used to be two layers sharing a box: a transparent textarea holding the caret, and a
// coloured copy of the same text painted behind it. That works until it does not, and the
// list of what it could never do is the list of what anybody expects of a pane they type code
// into -- line numbers, a matched bracket, a selection that is visible, an undo of its own.
// Every one of those was a layer with nothing to build it on.
//
// This is CodeMirror doing that job; vendor/README.md is what is vendored and how. The
// colouring is still ours: `runsFor` in source.js is the one description of what QML, YAML,
// SQL and a contract look like, and this turns its runs into decorations. Nothing about the
// syntax is written twice, so the pane and the canvas cannot drift apart -- the members
// written along a link and the file they are declared in are coloured by one reader.
