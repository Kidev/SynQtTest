// What this browser remembers between visits, and the two very different reasons it does.
//
// The pane sizes belong to the person and their screen. They are three numbers, they are read
// before the first paint, and they must never end up in the project: a colleague pulling the
// repository should not inherit somebody else's idea of how wide a sidebar is. They are kept
// as *fractions* of the window rather than pixels, so a layout arranged on one monitor is
// still the same layout on another, and clamped on the way back in so a stored value from a
// very large screen cannot leave a pane unusable on a small one. localStorage, because three
// numbers read synchronously at start-up is exactly what it is for.
//
// The document belongs to the work. On synqt.org there is no SynQt behind the page, so a
// design lives only in the tab it was drawn in, and closing that tab has been enough to lose
// an afternoon. It is a whole project, QML text and all, so it goes in IndexedDB: room to
// grow, and asynchronous, so restoring it never blocks the first frame.
//
// The one thing neither of them may ever do is show somebody a project that is not the
// project. When `synqt design` is serving this page, the disk is the truth and nothing stored
// here is restored over it.
