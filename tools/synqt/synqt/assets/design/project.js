// The project a design document describes, rendered as text in the browser.
//
// This is for the hosted copy alone. Run locally there is a CLI behind the page: it works
// the change set out on disk with the same scaffolders `synqt add entity` and `synqt add
// contract` run, shows it as a diff, and writes nothing until somebody has read it. On
// synqt.org there is no disk and no CLI, so what the page offers instead is a download, and
// this is what fills it.
//
// It is a second writer, so it is held to the one job it can do honestly: a project that
// does not exist yet, rendered from the document alone. It never rewrites a synqt.yaml that
// is already there. The document models a topology and its contracts and nothing else, so
// rewriting a file that also holds scopes, security, TLS files and provider settings would
// quietly drop them; on a real project the original is on disk, and the server is what
// edits it.
//
// Every entity in the document has a directory here, and every directory has its own file
// from the moment the entity exists: a client's is `Main.qml`, because the generated client
// main.cpp loads the QML module's `Main` and nothing else, and every other entity's is a
// `pragma Shared` file named after it. A Source per owned connect point follows. An entity with
// no files would be an entity that is on the canvas, is in synqt.yaml, and cannot be found
// anywhere in the project it belongs to.
//
// Pure functions over the document, no DOM: the suite renders a project with node and hands
// it to `synqt check`, which is what stops this drifting from what `synqt new` writes.
