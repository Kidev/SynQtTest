// How big the wire is: what a contract's members cost in bytes when they cross the link.
//
// A connect point says what crosses it. This says how much, because the two questions are
// asked together and only one of them had an answer on the page: a reader looking at a model
// of eight roles and a `string[280]` beside it has no idea whether that is a packet or a
// page, and the difference is what decides whether a property is pushed on every keystroke or
// on a timer.
//
// The numbers are QDataStream's, which is what QtRemoteObjects serialises with, and they are
// bounds rather than measurements: a `string[60]` is 4 bytes of length and at most 60 UTF-16
// code units, so 124, and a shorter one is shorter. That is the useful direction to be wrong
// in. What a member costs is stated as "at most" wherever every part of it is bounded, and as
// unbounded wherever one part is not -- an unsized `string` has no ceiling at all, and a
// number invented for it would be the one thing on this page that was made up.
//
// This is the whole of what the editor knows about wire size. Nothing here is a rule: `synqt
// check` has no opinion about how big a contract is, and neither does the drawing. It is a
// reading, offered where the contract is written.

// What one value of each type costs, serialised.
//
// QDataStream writes a QString as a quint32 byte count followed by UTF-16, so a bounded
// string of n characters is 4 + 2n; a QUrl goes across as the QString of its text. A
// QDateTime is a qint64 Julian day, a quint32 of milliseconds and a qint8 of the time spec.
// A QVariant carries its type id and a null flag in front of the value, which is the 5 bytes
// `wrapped` adds.
