// What lights up on the drawing, and why.
//
// Here rather than inside the editor because the editor is not the only thing that draws
// this picture: the home page draws it too, with the same `draw`, out of the same document.
// A second, thinner answer to "which end of this line is that entity" written for that page
// would be a second answer, and the first week either changed they would disagree. Same
// reasoning that put the card in tip.js.
//
// Two states, two colours, on purpose. Selection is what the panel has open: it stays where
// it was put and is what a reader is working on. Hover is where the pointer is this instant.
// In one colour the drawing lost track of the first every time somebody moved the pointer
// across it, which on a canvas of a dozen links is exactly when knowing which line you are
// working on matters most.
//
// A thing hovered lights everything that is the same fact as itself: a line lights the
// contract it carries, because that is what crosses it, and the scope seat it lands on,
// because that is who answers it. Pointing at a line and being shown only the line leaves
// the two ends of the question -- what crosses, and who serves it -- for the reader to trace
// by eye across whatever else the canvas holds.
//
// Nothing here reads the editor's state and nothing here redraws. `redraw()` from a
// pointermove path is how the double-click bug comes back; all of this puts a class on an
// element already in the document and takes it off again.
