// files pane that is the same project seen as text, the request that reads it back out of the
// project's own QML, and the two that turn it into files.
//
// Nothing here writes to the project. Editing changes a document held in this tab; Review
// asks the server what applying it would do and shows the diff; Apply names the change set
// that was shown, by its digest, and the server refuses anything else. The rules the page
// paints while you drag are rules.js, a subset of `synqt check` that the suite holds to the
// same verdicts, and the verdict that decides is the one the server returns.
//
// The canvas and the files pane are two views of one document and neither is a copy: typing a
// property into an owner's Source adds the member the panel would have added, and reaching
// for something another entity owns draws the connect point that would have had to exist. A
// design cannot be drawn one way and written another, because there is only one of it.
//
// Run with no server behind it (the copy on synqt.org) the page still edits, and Apply
// becomes a download of the project it would have written.
