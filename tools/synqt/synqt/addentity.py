"""``synqt add entity`` and ``synqt providers``: scaffold an entity of a given type.

An entity is instantiated with secure defaults: the embedded provider needs no
configuration; an external provider is masked behind the same entity, its secret recorded
as an ``env:`` reference (with a ``.env.example`` entry) and its connection forced to
verified TLS. The connect point Source calls only the provider interface, so the engine
choice never leaks into the rest of the system.
