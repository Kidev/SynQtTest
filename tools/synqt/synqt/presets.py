"""Generate the multi-binary CMake presets for a project.

Each entity is a CMake target with a preset. Native service entities (and the native
desktop client) use a host preset; the WebAssembly client uses a preset with the pinned
emsdk toolchain file and the WebAssembly Qt kit. The CLI fronts these presets, but a
contributor can drive CMake directly with them.
