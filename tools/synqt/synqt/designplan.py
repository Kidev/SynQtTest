"""What applying a design document would do to a project, worked out before any of it runs.

The editor may do anything a person can do to a topology, deletions included, so what keeps
it safe is not a short list of permitted verbs: it is that nothing happens until somebody has
read what is about to happen. :func:`compute` turns a document into a change set, :func:`diff`
renders that change set as one unified diff, and :func:`digest` fingerprints it so the thing
finally applied is provably the thing that was shown.

Nothing here writes into the project. The changes are worked out in a throwaway copy of it,
by running the same scaffolders `synqt add entity` and `synqt add connect-point` run, so the
files a plan promises are the files those commands would actually produce rather than a
second guess at their output.
