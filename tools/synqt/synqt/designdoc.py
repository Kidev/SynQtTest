"""A project read as one document: its entities, the links between them, and the
contract each link carries.

The editor draws this and the inference writes it, so it is the one shape both agree on.
Everything in it comes from ``synqt.yaml``, which holds the topology and, on each connect
point, what crosses it. One exception: where a node sits on the canvas is a drawing, not a
fact about the system, so it lives beside the project in ``.synqt/design.json`` and never
in the configuration. A project nobody has opened in the editor still lays out, from
the one rule worth stating by default: the browser on the left, the edge it reaches in the
middle, and everything it must not reach on the right.

The document is deliberately narrower than the configuration. It models the topology and
the contracts, because that is what there is to draw; it says nothing about TLS files,
provider settings, scopes or routes. :func:`to_config` therefore takes the configuration it
came from, so that what the document does not model is carried across rather than dropped:
validating a plan against a config that had quietly lost every ``scope:`` would be
validating a more permissive project than the one about to be written.
