"""The scope vocabulary, as a QML enum generated from ``scopes.order``.

One module rather than a helper in each caller, because two of them need the same answer:
:mod:`synqt.appgen` writes ``Scope.qml`` and :mod:`synqt.check` validates a mapping hook
against the members it would have written. Two copies of the name mapping would be two
answers to "what is ``power_user`` called", and the one that is wrong is whichever one is
not the file on disk.

A member's value is its index in ``scopes.order``, which is also its authority rank under
``scopes.hierarchical``. That is what removes the round trip: the hook returns the member,
the edge is handed the integer, and resolving it is ``scopeOrder[value]`` with a bounds
check. There is no spelling anywhere in the middle to keep in step.
