"""Copy every entity's QML into ``generated/``, with the root object made loadable.

A SynQt file is named after the thing it is, and its root object is written as that thing::

    // web/edge/Edge.qml
    Edge {
        id: root
        ...
    }

That reads correctly, and for a connect point it *is* correct: the owner's file is the
Source of the point, the point's contract compiles to a type of the same name, and
``import SynQt`` puts that type in scope. An explicit import beats the implicit import of
the containing directory, so ``Edge`` there is the contract, not the file.

An entity that exports nothing has no such type, and QML resolves the name to the file
itself. That is not an error the engine can shrug off; it refuses the document with "Edge
is instantiated recursively", at start-up, with nothing built to point at. So the same
sentence is either the whole point or a fatal load failure depending on a fact the author
cannot see from the file.

This pass makes the sentence always mean the first thing. It mirrors each entity folder
into ``generated/`` and retypes a self-named root to ``QtObject`` wherever no type of that
name exists, leaving the connect point case exactly as written. The author's tree keeps the
name the author chose, and nothing in it is ever rewritten; the copy the engine loads is
the one that had to differ, which is the rule the rest of ``generated/`` already follows.

``QtObject`` is the substitute because it is what the scaffold writes for an entity with
nothing exported (:func:`synqt.addentity.entity_qml`), so this only ever produces a file
the author could have written by hand. A view that wanted ``Item`` has to say ``Item``:
guessing a visual base from a file name would be inventing a parent, and the one place it
would matter most (a client's ``Main.qml``, which has to be a window) is already an error
that :func:`synqt.check.lint_client_root` reports in those words.
