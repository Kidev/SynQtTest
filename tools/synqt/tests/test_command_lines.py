"""The commands the CLI decides to run, and what it refuses to run them for.

These are the parts of `synqt docker`, `synqt build --deploy` and `synqt test` that decide
something before any process starts: which compose binary exists, whether the tree is in a
state the command can work on, which targets a client selector resolves to, and what a
finished deploy tells you to do next. All of it is reachable without Docker, CMake or a Qt
kit, which is why it is worth holding down here rather than in a suite that needs all three.
