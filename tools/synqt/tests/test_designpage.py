"""The editor's page: what it may not contain, and what its second writer writes.

Two things about this page are worth holding down from here rather than from a browser.

The first is that it runs under the policy the server sends it with, which allows nothing
inline and nothing from anywhere else. That is a property of the text of the page, so it is
checked as text: an inline handler or a script body added later would still load in whatever
browser someone tested in, with the policy quietly refusing it somewhere else.

The second is that the hosted copy renders synqt.yaml itself, because there is no CLI behind
it to do it. That is a second writer, and the only way it stays honest is to render a project
here with node and hand the result to `synqt check` and to the contract parser the build
uses.
