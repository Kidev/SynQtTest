"""The mirror under ``generated/`` that makes a file rooted at its own name loadable.

The behaviour under test is one QML rule, measured in tests/m1-contract and quoted here:
``Ledger.qml`` whose root object is ``Ledger`` resolves that name to the file itself and
the engine refuses the document with "Ledger is instantiated recursively". A connect
point's Source is the exception, because ``import SynQt`` puts a type of that name in scope
and an explicit import beats the implicit import of the containing directory.
