"""The attack index is a list of claims, and this is what keeps them true.

`tests/security/attacks.json` names every attack SynQt says it defends and, for each one,
the test that proves it still fails. The tests themselves live beside the code they are
about, because that is where somebody changing that code will run them. What the index adds
is the half a scattered set of tests cannot give: a reader can see the attack surface in one
sitting, and an entry that names a test which no longer exists is caught here rather than
noticed years later by whoever wondered if it was ever covered.

This runs in the ordinary pytest job, on all three platforms, because it needs no Qt and no
build: it reads two files and asks whether the second contains what the first says it does.
