"""The `network:` block, and the two other refusals a malformed entity earns.

`network:` is closed unless it is written, so everything here is about a surface somebody
deliberately opened. The refusals are all one shape: a block that looks configured and is
not, or one that is open wider than whoever wrote it meant. A key written as a literal, an
inbound port serving plaintext, a limit set to zero that refuses every request instead of
disabling itself; each reads as configuration and none of them is, and none of them shows
up until the entity is running somewhere real.

The two at the end are neighbours rather than network rules. A misspelled `type:` produces
an entity whose helpers are all missing and whose files go to the wrong folder, with every
symptom pointing somewhere other than the typo. A leftover `name:` on a connect point is the
older form of the same thing: everything derived from the name moves, so the build looks for
one file while consumers reach another.
