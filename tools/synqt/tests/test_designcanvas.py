"""The slot ring an entity's rim carries, checked by running the module the browser runs.

A connect point hangs off one slot on its owner's rim, and the slot it was drawn on is the
slot it keeps: an owner that outgrows its ring doubles it rather than renumbering, so a ninth
connect point never slides the eight already on screen. That is arithmetic, so it is written
as arithmetic in canvas.js and asserted here through node, the same way tools/check-designrules
asserts rules.js. Nothing here needs a browser, because none of it touches the DOM.
