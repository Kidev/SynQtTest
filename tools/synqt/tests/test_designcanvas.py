"""What the drawing works out rather than draws, checked by running the module the browser runs.

A connect point hangs off one slot on its owner's rim, and the slot it was drawn on is the
slot it keeps: an owner that outgrows its ring doubles it rather than renumbering, so a ninth
connect point never slides the eight already on screen. A line into a front that no scope
routes to is cut on its own curve, three quarters of the way to the end it fails to reach.
Both are arithmetic, so both are written as arithmetic in canvas.js and asserted here through
node, the same way tools/check-designrules asserts rules.js. Nothing here needs a browser,
because none of it touches the DOM.
