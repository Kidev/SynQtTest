"""A nested event loop in the runtime does not lend its caller's trace to what it serves.

A bounded wait spins a `QEventLoop`, which keeps serving: the work resumed inside it is
other callers' calls arriving on the same thread, while the span installed on that thread
belongs to the caller doing the waiting. Left in place it becomes the parent of theirs, and
one click's trace ends up holding another person's requests, which is a false answer to the
question an operator follows a trace to ask.

`SynQt::TraceScope` detaches for the length of each wait. This is a test rather than a
comment because the failure is silent, remote-triggerable by ordinary traffic, and visible
only in a record somebody reads days later: nothing crashes, nothing is refused, and the
console simply shows two stories as one.

It is written against the source because there is no run-time hook for "a loop was spun".
A wait added later is the case it exists to catch.
