"""The scope vocabulary the build generates from `scopes.order`.

The point of the enum is that a mapping hook cannot spell a scope wrong: it returns a
member, the edge is handed that member's index, and the index is looked up in the same
list the enum was generated from. So the rules worth testing are the ones that keep the
two ends the same list: the mapping from a scope name to a member is one function, a
collision is refused rather than merged, and the values are the indices.
