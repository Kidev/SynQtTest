"""A `behind:` block, held to the thing it claims to be.

A front is a web edge that owns a connect point it does not implement: it terminates the
browser link, holds the session, runs the sign-in, and then hands each caller to whichever
entity serves people of their scope. What makes that safe is that a caller only ever reaches
the one entity their scope names, so the entity behind the front authorizes on `Caller` alone
and never asks about scope at all.

That property is not something the runtime can check for itself. It holds only while the
front and the entities behind it agree about what crosses, and every way of disagreeing looks
like ordinary configuration until somebody is on the wrong side of it: a member the front
offers and nobody behind it answers is a call into nothing, and a member an entity carries
that the front offers to nobody is reachable by no caller, which is either dead or a
mistake about who was supposed to reach it. These are the tests for both directions, and for
each way of naming an entity that cannot be behind a front at all.

The scope-gate tests at the end are the neighbouring rule: a `<scope>` written on a member
is checked against a caller's session, which only a browser caller has, and against the scope
the point itself already requires.
