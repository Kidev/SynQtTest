"""One Qt is pinned, and every file in the build names that one.

SynQt pins one Qt (`toolchain.QT_VERSION`) and says so in CLAUDE.md, because the path it
depends on is the unsupported one and is not assumed to behave the same across versions.
A `find_package(Qt6 <older>)` in a library or a test does not honour that pin: it accepts
whatever kit is on the machine as long as it is at least that old, so a build against the
wrong Qt configures and compiles and only differs at run time.

This is a test rather than a review note because the last pin move proved it: the root
CMakeLists was raised by hand and all fifty other floors in src/, tests/, benchmarks/ and
the generated project CMake were left behind, with nothing anywhere reporting it.
