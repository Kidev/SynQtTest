"""Taking the commentary out of a file the editor scaffolds, and leaving the licence on.

The rule exists twice: once in Python, for the editor with a CLI behind it, and once in
JavaScript, for the copy on the site that has no disk to write to. Both write files somebody
then has to build, so the last test here runs them over the same inputs and fails when they
disagree.
