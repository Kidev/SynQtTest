"""The contract type vocabulary and its lowering to C++/rep types.

A type is a name and, for the ones that can be bounded, a size in brackets:
``string[64]`` is at most 64 characters, ``int16`` is a 16-bit integer. The size is
part of the contract, not a comment about it: it decides how wide the value is on the
wire, and the generated owner-side boundary refuses a value that does not fit rather
than truncating it into something that looks fine.
