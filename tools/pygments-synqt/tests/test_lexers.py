"""Unit tests for the SynQt docs lexers.

Run with: python3 -m pytest tools/pygments-synqt/tests

These cover the token decisions the docs' colors are built on, in particular the
runtime accessors: which names are one, which lookalikes are not, and the CSS class
Pygments writes for them, which docs/stylesheets/extra.css targets by name.
