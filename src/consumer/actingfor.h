/// but the person the edge is answering is known only to the edge, and a service two links
/// from the browser would otherwise see a call from "edge" and nothing else.
///
/// So a slot call on a connect point that is reached over the mesh carries one extra value:
/// the session the calling entity is acting for. This class is where that value waits. The
/// generated Source helper opens one of these around the owner's implementation of a slot,
/// naming the Caller that slot is answering; any outbound call the implementation then
/// makes reads current() and carries it on. Work that finishes later, in a timer or a
/// continuation, is outside the object's life and carries no session, which is right: by
/// then the entity is acting on its own behalf. It still carries the trace, which is the
/// thread's and not the caller's; see TraceScope.
///
/// One entity is one event loop, so nothing here is contended; the storage is per thread
/// anyway, so that stays true of a runtime that one day runs a slot somewhere else. It
/// nests: the object restores whatever it displaced.
