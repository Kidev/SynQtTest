/// the session the calling entity is acting for. This class is where that value waits. The
/// generated Source helper opens one of these around the owner's implementation of a slot,
/// naming the Caller that slot is answering; any outbound call the implementation then
/// makes reads current() and carries it on. Work that finishes later, in a timer or a
/// continuation, is outside the object's life and carries nothing, which is right: by then
/// the entity is acting on its own behalf.

/// One entity is one event loop, so this is a plain static rather than thread-local
/// storage, and it nests: the object restores whatever it displaced.
