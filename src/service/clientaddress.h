/// Which address is the caller, when the peer might be a load balancer.
///
/// Every per-IP limit is only as good as its notion of "IP". Facing the internet directly
/// that is the peer address and nothing else can be believed. Behind a balancer the peer
/// is the same address for every caller at once, so those limits would either collapse
/// onto it or stop limiting anything, and the caller's real address is in a header that
/// any client can also write.
///
/// So the rule is two-sided and neither half is optional:
///
/// 1. The forwarding header is read only when the DIRECT PEER is one the deployment named
///    in its trusted-proxy list. From anyone else it is a field the client filled in.
/// 2. Within it, only the rightmost entry that is not itself a named hop is taken.
///    Entries to the left of that are whatever the client sent, because a balancer
///    appends what it saw rather than replacing what was there.
///
/// The default (an empty list) trusts nothing and answers the peer address, which is the
/// behaviour of every SynQt edge that predates this class.
///
/// Two surfaces configure it, because they are two listeners and a deployment may put a
/// proxy in front of one and not the other: the browser side reads `public.trusted_proxies`
/// and the inbound API surface reads `network.inbound.trusted_proxies`. Neither inherits
/// the other's list. It lives in the service library rather than the edge one so both can
/// have it without an API entity linking Qt HTTP Server twice over.
