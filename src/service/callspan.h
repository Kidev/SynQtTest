/// One slot call crossing a link, timed and recorded however it leaves.
///
/// Generated Source helpers declare one of these at the top of every slot body. A slot has
/// several ways out (a scope gate, a bound on an argument, a relay to the entity behind a
/// front, the owner's own QML), so the record is closed by the destructor rather than by a
/// line before each `return`, which is how a return added later stays traced.
///
/// What it records is the **shape** of the call and not its contents: the contract, the
/// member, whether a person or an entity is calling, and how many arguments there were.
/// Argument values are what a user typed, and a monitor is not the place they end up; a
/// member that genuinely needs them says so in its contract (see `capture`).
///
/// Nothing is minted while tracing is off. The constructor reads one atomic, and if the
/// answer is no it does nothing else. Otherwise the span is opened here and now and made
/// the current one for as long as the slot runs (TraceScope): a call the slot makes on
/// another entity carries it, a record written meanwhile joins it, and a promise the slot
/// creates keeps it for its continuation. That is what makes a click one trace rather than
/// one root per entity, and it is why the span is opened for a call that may well turn out
/// not to be recorded: everything that hangs off it happens while the call is still
/// running, which is before anyone can know how it ends.
///
/// One invariant holds this together, and it is worth stating because nothing enforces it:
/// **a slot must not spin a nested event loop.** The span it opened is the thread's for as
/// long as it runs, so work resumed inside such a loop is another caller's call recorded
/// under this one's trace. Today nothing does (the identity waits are reached from a route
/// handler or a timer, never from a slot, which is what
/// `OAuthBackend::exchangeAsync` exists for); a slot that starts to would merge two
/// people's stories into one, and the console would show them as one click.
