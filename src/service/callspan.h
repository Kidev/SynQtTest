/// front, the owner's own QML), so the record is closed by the destructor rather than by a
/// line before each `return`, which is how a return added later stays traced.
///
/// What it records is the **shape** of the call and not its contents: the contract, the
/// member, whether a person or an entity is calling, and how many arguments there were.
/// Argument values are what a user typed, and a monitor is not the place they end up; a
/// member that genuinely needs them says so in its contract (see `capture`).
///
/// Nothing is minted while tracing is off. The constructor reads one atomic, and if the
/// answer is no it stores a start time and does nothing else; identifiers are generated in
/// the destructor, only for a call that is actually going to be recorded.
