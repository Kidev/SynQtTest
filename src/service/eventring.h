/// It is bounded because the alternative is worse in exactly the situation monitoring
/// exists for. An unbounded queue under a burst grows until the entity is killed for its
/// memory, and a queue that blocks its producer makes every slot call wait on the
/// monitor: either way the observability of an entity in trouble is what finishes it off.
/// So this one has a ceiling, and it drops the oldest to stay under it. What it never
/// does is lie about it: `dropped()` counts every event that did not fit, and the writer
/// reports that count so a gap in the record is visible as a gap.
///
/// Locking is one `QMutex`, not a lock-free queue, deliberately. The critical section is
/// a move and two integer updates, and it is uncontended in the common case, whereas a
/// lock-free ring is a great deal of subtle code to save nanoseconds on a path that is
/// already off the wire. Whether that judgement holds is measured rather than argued:
