/// The half of monitoring that lives in every reporting entity: it takes each batch the
/// tracer hands it and pushes it to the monitor, keeping what the monitor did not get.
///
/// A monitor is a service like any other, so it can be restarting, redeploying, or simply
/// slower than the entity reporting to it. Three things follow, and they are the whole
/// design:
///
/// 1. **Nothing waits.** A publish is a fire-and-forget slot on a Replica. If the Replica
///    is not there, the batch goes to the spool and the call returns. An entity must never
///    be slowed down, let alone blocked, by the thing watching it.
/// 2. **What was missed is kept.** The window around a restart is the window an operator
///    is usually looking at, so an unreachable monitor means a file on disk rather than a
///    gap. The spool is replayed oldest first when the link comes back.
/// 3. **The spool is bounded, and says when it drops.** A monitor that never comes back
///    must not fill the entity's disk. Past the cap the oldest batches go, and how many
///    went is reported to the monitor when it returns, so the gap is visible as a gap.
///
/// Everything here runs on the tracer's writer thread, which is where the sink is called,
/// so the entity's own event loop never touches this.
