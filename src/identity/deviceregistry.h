/// The durable half of staying signed in on the desktop: one row per enrolled device,
/// holding what it takes to mint that visitor a fresh session and nothing that is itself a
/// session.
///
/// Three properties are the whole design, and each one exists because the obvious
/// alternative (persist the session id) fails at it:
///
///  1. **Single use with rotation.** Every redemption issues the next generation and retires
///     the one presented, so a credential read off a disk is only good until the machine it
///     was taken from next starts up.
///  2. **Reuse detection.** A retired generation presented past the overlap window means two
///     copies of it exist, so the family and every session descended from it are revoked.
///     This is the property no file permission gives: theft stops being silent and becomes
///     an event the edge sees. (RFC 6819 s.5.2.2.3, applied to our own credential rather
///     than to the provider's refresh token.)
///  3. **A short session at the end of it.** What a redemption buys is a session of exactly
///     the length a browser gets, so "stay signed in for a month" never becomes "a stolen
///     file is good for a month".
///
/// The secret is never stored, here or anywhere on the edge: what a row holds is a SHA-256
/// of it. A single hash and not a password KDF, deliberately, because there is no
/// low-entropy secret to stretch (the credential is 256 random bits) and a KDF would only
/// add latency to every relaunch.
