// The Article 17 request ("right to erasure"), as a button and a confirmation.
//
// It carries the request no further than the app: `confirmed` is the signal, and what an
// app connects it to is a slot on one of its own connect points, because the app is what
// knows where its data is. The framework will not invent a route that answers "accepted"
// and erases nothing.
//
// Visible only to a signed-in visitor, and only when the project set `privacy.erasure`.
// Both halves matter. An anonymous visitor's request names no data to erase, and an app
// that has not turned the key on has nobody undertaking to act on what the button sends.
