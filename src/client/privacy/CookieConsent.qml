// SynQt sets one cookie, the session credential. Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive
// exempts storage that is strictly necessary to provide the service the visitor asked for,
// and a session the app cannot work without is that, so a project that adds no other cookie
// has nothing to ask about. Showing a banner anyway is not the safe choice it looks like:
// it trains visitors to dismiss a dialog that was asking nothing, and regulators have said
// so. So `privacy.cookies` starts empty, this stays invisible while it is, and the banner
// appears when somebody adds the category that made it necessary.
//
// Refusing is one tap, in the same place and the same weight as accepting, because consent
// under Article 4(11) has to be freely given and a banner where refusing is harder than
// accepting does not collect it.
