/// The macOS store: Keychain Services, a generic-password item under this app's service

/// Two flags carry the whole security position, and neither is a default:
///
///  - `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`. The `ThisDeviceOnly` half is the
///    load-bearing one: it keeps the item out of iCloud Keychain and out of an encrypted
///    backup restored onto another machine. Without it, "a credential for this device"
///    quietly becomes "a credential on every device signed into that Apple ID", which is the
///    one thing a device credential must not be.
///  - `kSecUseDataProtectionKeychain`, which is what gives the item a real per-application
///    boundary rather than a per-user one.
///
/// The second one has a consequence worth knowing before it surprises somebody: it needs a
/// keychain-access-group entitlement, so an unsigned or ad-hoc-signed build gets
/// `errSecMissingEntitlement` and this store falls back to the file-based keychain, reporting
/// Binding::User instead of Binding::Application. That is also the build whose code signature
/// changes on every rebuild, so macOS asks the developer for permission on every run. Both
/// are properties of an unsigned build, not faults; `synqt build --deploy --sign` is what
/// buys the application boundary, and until now that flag was a Gatekeeper concern only.
