# Development-only code is absent from a release build, not disabled inside it.
#
# The distinction is the whole suite. A capability held back by an `if (devMode)` is still
# in the binary: it can be reached through a bug in whatever checks the flag, through an
# argument someone passes, or simply read out of the strings by anyone holding the artifact.
# SynQt's claim is stronger than that, so this proves the stronger thing: a release
# SynQtEdge does not contain the development sign-in at all.
#
# Three assertions, and the second is not padding. A test that only checks for absence
# passes on a build that contains nothing, which is how `identity.required` refused
# everybody in this tree for months; so the middle one builds the same library with the
# option on and requires the symbol to be there.
