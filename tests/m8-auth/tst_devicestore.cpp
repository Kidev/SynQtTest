// The client half of staying signed in: what goes into the OS secure store, that nothing
// goes anywhere else, and that a second launch really does come back signed in.
//
// The first test here is the one that matters most, and it is the one that would still pass
// if the feature were quietly broken: with no store available, nothing is written anywhere.
// There is no file fallback in SynQt, and the moment one exists every honest sentence about
// where this credential lives stops being true. It is asserted against the actual config,
// data and cache directories rather than against a promise in a comment.
//
// The rest needs a real keyring. On Linux ctest runs this suite through
// tests/lib/keyring-session.sh, which gives it a private session bus and a private keyring
// rather than the developer's own, so the Secret Service backend is exercised on a CI runner
// too. Where those tools are absent the tests skip, which is the right outcome and not a gap:
// it is exactly what a visitor on such a machine gets, which is a sign-in per launch. CI sets
// SYNQT_REQUIRE_SECURE_STORE on the column that does provide one, so a skip there is a broken
// recipe and fails rather than passing quietly.
