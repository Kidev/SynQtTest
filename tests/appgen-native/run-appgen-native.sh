# Prove the app generator (tools/synqt appgen) emits code that actually COMPILES, end to end,
# on the native host kit. The appgen unit tests assert the generated strings; this fixture goes
# further and builds them, which is the only thing that catches a missing include or a CMake
# collision. It found three real defects the string tests could not:
#   * the root CMake added SynQtProviders a second time (binary-dir collision); SynQtService
#     already pulls it in;
#   * the service main used QJsonObject with only <QJsonDocument> included (forward-declared);
#   * the edge main upcast QQmlPropertyMap* to QObject* without <QQmlPropertyMap>.
#
# It runs appgen over the real three-entity gavel topology (client + web edge + relational
# database, with connect points, a scope-gated point, identity, and a provider), then configures and
# builds every entity with the native kit. The client's `targets: [wasm]` also builds as a
# native desktop app here, which exercises the client main too. A green run means the generator
# produces buildable code for the full service/edge/provider path.
#
# Two fixtures then go past compiling and RUN what was generated, because their claims are not
# about the compiler: `routed/` says every declared route resolves to its view, and `promoted/`
# says `identity.provider_entity` moves the client secret and the token exchange off the edge.
