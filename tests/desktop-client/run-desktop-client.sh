# Prove the NATIVE DESKTOP client target actually compiles, installs, and boots; the missing
# analogue of tests/appgen-native, which builds the service/edge mains but never drove the
# `synqt build --client desktop` tooling path end to end. The desktop client shares the client
# QML and SynClient runtime with the WASM build; only two things differ (docs/desktop.md): it
# terminates its own TLS with QSslSocket, and it reads the edge URL from build.desktop.edge_url
# instead of the served page. This fixture exercises exactly that path:
#
#   1. materialize the three-entity gavel topology and mark the client `targets: [wasm, desktop]`
#      with a distinctive build.desktop.edge_url;
#   2. run the real tooling (presets.write + build.compile_incremental(client="desktop")), which
#      generates the client main/CMake, configures the host preset, compiles the client on the
#      native kit, and installs it under build/client-desktop/linux/;
#   3. assert the installed binary is a native executable, that the configured edge URL is baked
#      into it (SYNQT_EDGE_URL; the desktop client has no serving origin to read it from), and
#      that it boots the QML engine + SynClient without crashing (offscreen, edge unreachable).
#
# The string-level unit tests assert the generated CMake/main text; only a real build catches a
# missing link library, a CMake collision, or (as this fixture first found) build.desktop.
# edge_url never being passed to the compile. Needs the pinned host kit (/opt/Qt/6.11.1/gcc_64).

# Usage: tests/desktop-client/run-desktop-client.sh
