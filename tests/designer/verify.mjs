// The design editor, in a real browser, both ways it is reached.
//
// Case 1 is the editor over a project: `synqt design` on a copy of the gavel example, and a
// browser that adds a service, drags a connect point from it to the web edge, names the
// point and its contract, says a slot crosses it, reviews the change set and applies it. The
// verdict is on disk afterwards, in the two files it wrote: synqt.yaml, which carries what
// crosses the point, and the Source the owner hosts it with. Everything between the click and
// the file is what this covers, and
// none of it can be reached from Python: the canvas, the drag, the inspector, and the plan
// digest that ties Apply to the change set that was shown.
//
// Case 2 is the copy the documentation site publishes, which has no server behind it. The
// assets are served as static files under the policy the CLI's own server sends, which is
// the policy that copy has to live under, and the page has to come up as a drawing board with
// Apply offering a download. Nothing may be fetched from another origin and nothing may be
// refused by the policy; the CLI has a server sending that header on every response, and the
// hosted copy has nobody, so this is where it is measured.
//
// Chromium only, deliberately. What is being proven here is this page's own behaviour, not
// an engine's: the transport proofs that are per-engine questions are tests/m0-transport and
// tests/m6-client. Exits 0 only if both cases pass.
