#
#   tests/lib/keyring-session.sh <command> [args...]
#
# The Linux half of docs/desktop.md#storing-the-session is libsecret talking to
# org.freedesktop.secrets, and neither a CI runner nor a container has that: no session bus,
# no unlocked collection, so every store test skips and the backend that ships to visitors is
# never exercised anywhere. This is what gives it one, and it is deliberately the same command
# in CI and on a developer's machine.
#
# Everything it makes is private and thrown away: its own session bus, its own keyring
# directory, and a login keyring created there with an empty password. That is not only
# hygiene, it is what makes the run reproducible. A developer's real keyring is already
# unlocked and already has a default collection, so a test that used it would pass here and
# fail on a fresh machine for reasons nobody could see; and a suite that writes a credential
# has no business writing it into the keyring somebody keeps their life in.
#
# When either tool is missing it runs the command directly and says so. The store is then
# unavailable, the tests that need one skip, and that is the honest outcome for such a
# machine rather than a failure: it is exactly what a visitor there gets, which is a sign-in
# per launch.
