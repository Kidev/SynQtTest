# With the development sources, because this suite is where the development scope picker's
# runtime behaviour is proved: that a development edge serves it only when asked. The other
# half of that claim, that a release edge does not contain the picker at all, is
# tests/dev-exclusion's, and it configures both ways to prove it. tests/run-all.sh passes
# the same flag, so a full run and a single-suite run build the same library.
