// The rate-window table on its own, which is where the interesting case is.
//
// Three gates in this framework ration by client address: the monitor's password route, the
// device-credential route, and the API server. Each keeps a table keyed by address, and each
// therefore has to answer the question this file is about: what happens when the table gets
// too big? The obvious answer is to empty it, and the obvious answer turns the ceiling into
// a reset primitive. An attacker who can present addresses (an IPv6 /64 is a practically
// unlimited supply, and so is a forwarding header on a deployment that trusts one) fills
// the table with entries they will never use again, the table is emptied, and their count
// against the address they are actually guessing from goes back to zero.
//
// A test through a real edge cannot reach this: it would have to arrive from four thousand
// addresses. The table is a pure function of what is in it and what time it is, which is
// why it is tested here instead, the way the client-address resolver next to it is.
