# The development scope picker, in a real browser, with a real cookie jar.
#  [1] write a three-scope project with the tooling;
#  [2] build its edge with SYNQT_DEV_TOOLS, which is the only build that has a picker;
#  [3] drive three tabs of one browser context through it with Playwright.
#
# The claim under test cannot be made from inside a process: two tabs of one browser share
# one cookie jar (RFC 6265 scopes a cookie to a host, not a port), and "the second sign-in
# did not become the first" is a statement about that jar. tests/m5-webedge proves the edge
# sets two cookies; only a browser proves two tabs then keep two sessions.
#
# No WebAssembly kit is needed and no client is built: which bundle the edge answers with
# is how this suite asks a tab who it is, and three directories of static HTML answer that
# question exactly as a compiled client would.
