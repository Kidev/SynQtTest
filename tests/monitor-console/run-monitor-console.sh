# The monitoring console, end to end, in a real browser.
#  [1] write the project with the scaffolder, exactly as a developer would;
#  [2] build the monitor and the reporting edge with the host kit;
#  [3] build the console for the browser with the WebAssembly kit;
#  [4] drive the delivery gate, the operator sign-in and the console via Playwright.
#
# Everything here is invisible to a compiler: a 404 for a bundle outside the caller's
# scope, an inline script the strict CSP has to allow, a Qt Quick scene that either draws
# or does not, and a row appearing in the monitor's own record. The project is generated
# rather than checked in, so what runs is what `synqt add entity --type monitor` produces
# today and not what it produced when somebody pasted it in.
