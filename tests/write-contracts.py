"""Write a project's generated contracts, for a C++ fixture that compiles against them.

What crosses a connect point is written on the point, in `synqt.yaml`, and `synqt build`
turns each block into the `.syn` the compiler reads. A fixture here builds one example's
QML with plain CMake rather than through the CLI, so it asks for that one step by itself:

    python3 tests/write-contracts.py <project-dir>

Prints each path it wrote, relative to the project.
