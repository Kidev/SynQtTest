// Memory acceptance: what a workload leaves behind.
//
// Every other suite asks whether one operation is correct. This one asks what a hundred
// thousand of them cost. A service entity runs for months without being restarted, so an
// object retained per browser connection, per request, or per reconnect is a defect even
// when every one of those operations is correct, and it is a defect nothing else here can
// see: the operation passes, the process exits, and the memory it kept goes back to the
// operating system with it.
//
// It is also the half a leak checker cannot cover. LeakSanitizer reports memory that is
// unreachable at exit, and every leak this framework has actually had was perfectly
// reachable: a promise parented to a facade that lives as long as the connection, a node
// replaced but not retired on reconnect, a verifier map nothing ever removed from. Those
// are leaks by the only definition that matters to a long-running edge (it grows until it
// dies) and are invisible by that other definition. So this suite measures the thing
// itself: run the same cycle many times over one long-lived object, twice, and require the
// second run to keep no more than the first. What that comparison is worth is checked
// first, by theBudgetCanTellALeakFromABusyProcess().
//
// run-leakcheck.sh is the other half, and runs the rest of the tree under LeakSanitizer.

    // for as long as the tab stays open, which is exactly the shape a browser client is
    // worst placed to survive.
