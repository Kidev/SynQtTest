# Run the suites that already exist, and ask what they left behind.
#
# tst_memory (the ctest suite next to this script) measures the paths it was written for.
# This asks the same question of everything else in the tree, in the two ways a leak can
# show itself:
#
#   soak      every suite run at two repeat counts, comparing the peak resident set. This
#             is the half that sees memory the process is still holding on purpose, which
#             is what a leak in a long-running entity looks like from outside.
#   sanitize  the same suites rebuilt with AddressSanitizer and run again, with every leak
#             LeakSanitizer reports charged to whoever allocated it. This is the half that
#             sees memory nothing points at any more, and it fails the run when a record
#             belongs to src/.
#
# Neither is cheap: both configure and build a tree (the sanitizer pass an instrumented one
# of its own), with the same flags tests/run-all.sh uses, so the binaries measured here are
# the binaries a developer just ran. Usage:
#
#   tests/memory/run-leakcheck.sh                # both passes
#   tests/memory/run-leakcheck.sh --soak         # the fast half, no instrumented rebuild
#   tests/memory/run-leakcheck.sh --sanitize
#   tests/memory/run-leakcheck.sh --benchmarks   # add the benchmark harnesses to the soak
#
# QT_HOST overrides the kit path, as in every other runner here.
