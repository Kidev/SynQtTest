# SynQt against the other frameworks, in both directions. Builds the SynQt harnesses, runs
# every column over the same sweep, and writes one baseline each under benchmarks/results/
# keyed by hostname. Pinned Qt 6.12.0.
#
# A column whose toolchain is not installed skips with a printed reason rather than failing
# the run. benchmarks/vs-frameworks/COLUMN-CONTRACT.md is what every column is held to.
#
# Node is the one runtime measured more than once, on every major in node/runtimes.txt: the
# active LTS is what a team is allowed to deploy and the current release is what the runtime
# can do today, and those are not the same number.

# Two tables come out of it. The live one first, which is the headline: one publisher, N
# subscribers, and the arguments above shape it. Then the call one: a caller asks and waits,
# which is the direction a Next.js Server Function goes, shaped by CALL_CALLERS,
# CALL_SECONDS and CALL_WORK instead (the two sweeps count different things, so one set of
# flags cannot mean the same thing to both).
#
# QT_HOST overrides the kit path and BENCH_OUT_DIR overrides where the baselines are
# written, so CI can run this against its own kit without writing into benchmarks/results/.
#
# The HTTP half is a separate run: those servers are driven by the loader in
# benchmarks/edge, which measures request throughput rather than propagation. See
# benchmarks/vs-frameworks/README.md.
