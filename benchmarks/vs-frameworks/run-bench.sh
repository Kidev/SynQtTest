# SynQt against Node.js, in both directions. Builds the SynQt harnesses, runs every column
# over the same sweep, and writes one baseline each under benchmarks/results/ keyed by
# hostname. Pinned Qt 6.11.1.
#
#   ./run-bench.sh
#   ./run-bench.sh --subscribers 10,50,100,250,500 --seconds 10 --hz 60
#
# Two tables come out of it. The live one first, which is the headline: one publisher, N
# subscribers, and the arguments above shape it. Then the call one: a caller asks and waits,
# which is the direction a Next.js Server Function goes, shaped by CALL_CALLERS,
# CALL_SECONDS and CALL_WORK instead (the two sweeps count different things, so one set of
# flags cannot mean the same thing to both).
#
# QT_HOST overrides the kit path and BENCH_OUT_DIR overrides where the baselines are
# written, so CI can run this against its own kit without writing into benchmarks/results/.
#
# The HTTP half is a separate run: those servers are driven by the loader in
# benchmarks/edge, which measures request throughput rather than propagation. See
# benchmarks/vs-frameworks/README.md.
