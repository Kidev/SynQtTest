"""Put the columns of the call-path comparison side by side.

The other direction from compare.py: there the owner publishes and N subscribers see it,
here a caller asks and waits for the answer. That is the shape a Next.js Server Function
has and the shape a connect point's returning slot has, which is why the two are measured
against each other at all.

Every column is printed, including a stack that lost. A comparison that only prints its
winner is an advertisement.
