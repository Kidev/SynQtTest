# The same fan-out, refitted at six payload sizes, to say what a stack's per-subscriber cost
# is actually made of.
#
# The headline sweep varies the number of subscribers and holds the payload at 256 bytes.
# That is the right shape for the comparison and it cannot answer one question: whether the
# marginal cost a column pays per subscriber is the bytes being copied for that subscriber
# or a syscall, a wakeup and a dispatch that would cost the same if the frame were empty.
# The two want opposite work. Sweeping the payload separates them, because a copy grows with
# the payload and an overhead does not.

#
# Three columns, not sixteen. This is not the comparison table; it is the instrument that
# reads the gap in it, and the gap is between SynQt, the same fan-out with the object
# protocol taken off (`qt-raw`), and the fastest honest Node. Every other column would add
# an hour to the run to answer a question nobody asked of it.
#
# Saturating, because the fit under it is only defined on a saturating run: a paced run
# spends the interval idle and the line through its points has no fixed cost in it. See
# fit.py, which is what reads the output.
