// Node's framework column of the live-path comparison: Next.js, doing the only live path
// Next.js has.
//
// Next.js ships no WebSocket server. The way a Next team serves "N subscribers see every
// change" without leaving the framework is a Route Handler returning a ReadableStream as
// `text/event-stream`, and that is what nextjs/app/live/route.js is. The framework holds the
// connections and writes the frames, so this measures Next.js rather than measuring
// something beside it.
//
// What it is not: a custom server with `ws` attached. That is `node-bare` with a Next.js
// process next to it (the frames never touch Next), and printing it under this heading
// would be labelling one stack with another's name. See README.md.
//
// Two things differ from the other columns, both stated rather than corrected for, because
// both are what this design actually costs a deployment:
//
//  * SSE is text, so the same eight-byte stamp and the same payload travel base64 in one
//    `data:` line: a third more bytes on the wire, and an encode per publish. Per publish
//    and not per subscriber (the route encodes once and enqueues the same bytes to every
//    open stream), so this is a fixed cost rather than the marginal one.
//  * SSE is one direction. There is nothing to compare on the way back, and this table
//    never measured that anyway: the workload is one publisher, N subscribers.
//
// Everything else is held constant with live-bare.mjs and live-socketio.mjs: the same clock,
// the same warm-up, the same measured window, the same drain, the same statistics, and
// publisher, subscribers and server in one process.
