// Node's framework column of the call comparison: Next.js Server Functions.
//
// The workload is the one SynQt's returning slot answers (a caller asks the server to do
// something and waits for the value back), and Server Functions are the Next.js feature
// that answers it in the same shape: a function the client calls, run on the server,
// returning a value. That is why this column is a Server Function and not a Route Handler.
// The Route Handler path is measured too, in the HTTP table, and the two together are the
// useful pair: they are the same server doing the same work with different framework
// machinery in front of it.
//
// Every call is the request React's client runtime makes, not a shortcut around it:
// ./serveraction.mjs reads the action id out of the build and POSTs the flight-encoded
// arguments to the page route. What is being measured therefore includes the action
// lookup, the flight decode of the arguments, the function body, and the flight encode of
// the result, all of which a deployment pays and none of which a direct import would show.
//
// Held constant with calls-bare.mjs: the clock, the warm-up, the closed loop, the measured
// window, the statistics, and caller and server in one process.
