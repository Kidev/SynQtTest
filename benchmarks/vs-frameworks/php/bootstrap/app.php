// Not the `laravel/laravel` skeleton: this column has no models, no views, no routes and no
// middleware, and a skeleton would commit forty files none of which the measurement reads.
// What is here is what Reverb and the broadcaster actually need, and `withExceptions()` is
// not optional despite being empty: it is what binds the exception handler the console
// kernel resolves before it runs anything.
