// The publisher half of the Laravel Reverb column: it goes through Laravel's broadcast path,
// which is what an application would do, and that path is a signed HTTP call into the Reverb
// process rather than a write to a socket this process holds.
//
// Its own process for that reason. Laravel's broadcaster blocks on the HTTP call, and a
// blocking publisher sharing a loop with the subscribers would stall their reads and put the
// harness's own latency into the measurement. That is the mistake the Action Cable column
// found the hard way (see the README).
//
// The stamp is hrtime(true), which is CLOCK_MONOTONIC on Linux and therefore system-wide:
// the subscriber process reads it back off the same clock, so the interval is still an
// interval across the two. See COLUMN-CONTRACT.md.
