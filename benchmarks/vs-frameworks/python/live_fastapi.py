"""Python's fast async column: FastAPI on uvicorn, WebSockets, no ORM and no middleware.

The same shape as ``node/live-bare.mjs``, deliberately, so a reader can put the two files
next to each other and see that the only difference is the runtime. Everything that is not
the server lives in ``measure.py``, which both Python columns share, so the difference
between this file and ``live_channels.py`` really is only the framework.

Publisher and subscribers share one process **and one event loop**, which is the honest way
to write this in asyncio and is what the contract asks for. What it costs, and what
``measure.py`` keeps the subscriber callback short for, is that a slow subscriber would
delay the publisher on the same loop: that would be a self-inflicted queue rather than a
property of the stack.
