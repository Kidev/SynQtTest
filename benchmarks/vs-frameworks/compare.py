"""Put the columns of the live-path comparison side by side.

Each result file holds the same sweep measured the same way; this turns them into the table
a reader actually wants, and derives the one figure an operator sizes a host with: how many
live users a core and a gigabyte hold.

# object protocol taken off it, because `qt-raw` is what separates "Qt's sockets are slow"
# from "the object protocol costs something" and those have different answers. Then the
# floors: the bare, frameworkless column of each runtime, which is the fastest honest
# anything and is what tells "SynQt is fast for a Qt thing" apart from "SynQt is fast". Then
# the frameworks, which is what a team actually deploys and therefore what the comparison is
# really about. `node-nextjs` sits at the end of the Node group because it is the one column
# not carrying WebSocket frames: Next has no WebSocket server, so its live path is
# server-sent events. See the README.

# A stack not listed here still prints, after these, so a column added without touching this
# line is visible rather than silently absent.
