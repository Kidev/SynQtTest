"""Hold the prose to the toolchain the file it names actually ran on.

`baselines.py` gates the claims a baseline supports: ratios, orderings, invariants. None of
those move when a harness is re-run on a newer Qt, which is exactly why the prose drifted
away from the files without anything failing. A whole sweep was re-run on 6.12.0 and
committed while six environment blocks went on saying 6.11.1, and the numbers beside them
went on describing a run nobody could reproduce.

So this reads the other half. Wherever a section of a README writes `results/<file>.json`
and a Qt version in the same breath, the version has to be the one inside that file. It is
a narrow check by design: a version string and a filename are unambiguous to parse, where a
table of measurements is not, and this is the class of drift that actually happened.

A file whose recorded version is `unknown` is a harness that could not ask its kit, which is
its own failure and is reported as one.
