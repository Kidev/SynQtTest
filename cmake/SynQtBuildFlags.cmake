# One statement of how SynQt is compiled: which language it is written in, which
# diagnostics stop the build, and what a release build is allowed to do to the binary.
#
# Every CMakeLists in this repository includes this file, and `synqt build` writes the
# same include into the CMakeLists it generates for an application, so a project built
# with SynQt is held to the standard SynQt holds itself to. Include it before the first
# `add_subdirectory()` or `add_executable()` of the directory: the options below are
# directory-scoped and reach every target created afterwards, including the runtime
# libraries a standalone suite pulls in.
#
# Warnings are errors because a warning nobody has to fix is a warning nobody fixes, and
# because the three compilers here disagree about which mistakes are worth mentioning:
# the narrowing conversion that broke the Windows and macOS columns compiled silently on
# GCC. `-DSYNQT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=OFF` turns the stop off for a bisect or for a new
# compiler release whose new warnings are not yet triaged; it is not meant to live in a
# preset.

# for tests/appgen-native's topologies, and once each for custom-provider, desktop-client
