# gavel: the auction tutorial, materialized

This is the finished project from the [auction tutorial](../../docs/tutorial.md): a live
auction with GitHub sign in and a permanent Hall of Fame, built from three entities.

```
browser --wss+session--> web edge --mesh mTLS--> books
                         (owns the live auction) (owns the Hall of Fame)
```

## Files, by tutorial page

Each entity owns one connect point, and every file is named after the entity rather than
after what it holds, so there is one name to learn per entity and nothing to keep in step
when a contract grows. The contracts themselves are the `export:` blocks in `synqt.yaml`;
nothing here writes a `.syn`, because `synqt` does.

| File | Tutorial page |
| --- | --- |
| `web/edge/Edge.qml`, `client/app/Main.qml`, the `edge` `export:` in `synqt.yaml` | [The base case](../../docs/tutorial-base-auction.md) |
| `web/edge/identity/map.qml`, `web/edge/.env.example`, `identity:` in `synqt.yaml` | [Real bidders](../../docs/tutorial-sign-in.md) |
| `db/relational/books/Books.qml`, `db/relational/books/schema.sql`, the `books` `export:` in `synqt.yaml`, the Hall of Fame half of `web/edge/Edge.qml` | [A permanent Hall of Fame](../../docs/tutorial-hall-of-fame.md) |

## The three hands-on checks

The tutorial's three "try it, then think" checks are kept as acceptance fixtures:

1. A lower bid is refused by the edge: the owner's `placeBid` slot rejects any bid that
   does not beat the standing one. Proven in `tests/fix1-auction`.
2. `placeBid` from the console while signed out is refused: the same slot rejects a
   caller without the `user` scope, whatever the UI shows. Proven in `tests/fix1-auction`.
3. Adding the client as a consumer of the books entity's connect point fails `synqt check`:
   a connect point the browser consumes must be owned by a web edge; the books entity is not.
   Proven in `tools/synqt/tests/test_examples.py`.

## A note on the connect-point Sources

The server-side Sources here (`web/edge/Edge.qml` and `db/relational/books/Books.qml`) use
the framework's owner API. `web/edge/Edge.qml` answers one caller with the typed sugar
`Caller.emit<Signal>(...)` (`Caller.emitBidRejected(reason)`), which the generator emits per
contract as a thin forwarder over `Caller.emitSignal(name, ...)`; the generic form still
works. It publishes the Hall of Fame by binding `winnersRows` to the rows it holds, so every
change to them republishes and nothing has to remember to.

On the consuming side, a connect point is reached through its generated facade, so the
ergonomic forms the tutorial prose favours are live: `<Owner>.on<Signal>` attached handlers
(no `target`, as `client/app/Main.qml` uses for `Edge.onBidRejected`) and returning-slot
`.then(...)` promises. The imperative `signal.connect(...)` and a `Connections` block remain
available for a dynamic target. What a client calls goes through `Server`, its alias for the
edge it is attached to; what an entity calls goes through the owner's name, which is why the
edge reaches the ledger as `Books`.

The `tests/fix1-auction` acceptance test drives these exact Source files, so this is the
runnable rendering. Both entities are shared, the default: one Source answers everybody,
and each caller reaches it through a mirror carrying their own `Caller`, which is what lets
a rejection go back to the one browser that bid too low.
