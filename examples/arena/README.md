# arena: the multiplayer tutorial, materialized

This is the finished project from the [multiplayer tutorial](../../docs/tutorial-multiplayer.md):
a small [agar.io](https://agar.io)-style arena where every signed-in, approved player is a
blob on a shared, server-authoritative map, with a ten-minute round and a permanent
all-time Hall of Fame behind the records entity.

```
many players --wss+session--> web edge --mesh mTLS--> records
                              owns + simulates the    (all-time
                              one authoritative arena; scores)
                              per-caller interest mgmt
```

## The three hands-on checks

The tutorial's three "try it, then think" checks are kept as acceptance fixtures:

1. `Server.steer(3999, 3999)` from the console only crawls, never teleports: the
   edge takes an aim point and integrates every blob's motion itself at the speed the blob's
   mass allows, so there is no position to forge. Proven in `tests/fix2-arena`.
2. A signed-out or unapproved caller never has `arena` acquired: the connect point's
   `scope: player` is the barrier, not the on-screen gate: an under-scoped session never
   acquires the Replica, so `steer`, `ping`, and the roster are all out of reach. Proven in
   `tests/fix2-arena`.
3. Adding the client as a consumer of the records entity's connect point fails
   `synqt check`: the browser can reach only the edge; the records entity is not a web
   edge. Proven in `tools/synqt/tests/test_examples.py`.

## A note on the connect-point Sources

The edge owns one authoritative arena, simulated once in the `web/edge/World.qml` singleton,
and gives each player a `web/edge/Edge.qml` Source that publishes only their slice; the
interest management the last tutorial page builds. The edge declares `shared: false`, so
there is one Source per caller: the framework instantiates the shared world once and injects
it into each per-session Source by name (`World`), the same way it injects the mesh accessor
`Records`. The `tests/fix2-arena` acceptance test drives that exact structure (a world
instantiated once, injected as `World`, a per-session `Edge` over it) to prove the movement
authority and the scope gate. Those two Sources use the framework's owner API
(`set<Model>(rows)`, `Caller.hasScope`); the champions and round mirroring reaches the
database through its generated consumer facade, so the returning-slot promise
(`Records.top().then(rows => ...)`) and the attached-signal handler
(`Records.on<Signal>`, no `target`) resolve as the tutorial prose writes them.
