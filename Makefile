# The commands this checkout is worked on with, in one place.
#
# None of this is the build. `synqt build` builds a SynQt application and CMake builds the
# framework; this file is the developer's side of the desk: install the CLI you are editing,
# run the suites, build the docs, and clear out the copies of SynQt that go stale and then
# quietly answer in place of the checkout.
#
# That last one is why this file exists. Three things on a developer's machine shadow the
# tree they are editing, and none of them announces itself:
#
#   * `~/.local/bin/synqt` -- an installed CLI. A release binary sitting there answers
#     `synqt design` with whatever it was built from, months ago. `make cli` replaces it
#     with an editable install of this checkout.
#   * `tools/synqt/synqt/framework/` -- a vendored copy of src/ and cmake/ that a wheel
#     build leaves behind. A stale one shadows `synqtc` in an interpreter that imports it,
#     and the whole test suite fails on contracts it parsed fine yesterday.
#   * `site/` -- MkDocs output. `site/designer/` in particular is a copy of the editor, and
#     opening it instead of `synqt design` shows an editor from whenever it was last built.
#
# `make doctor` reports all three without changing anything; `make clean-stale` clears them.

# Set up

# Editable, so the CLI on PATH is the tree being edited and not a snapshot of it.
#
# Through pipx rather than pip: this is an application and not a library, which is what pipx
# is for, and it is what the guide tells a reader to install SynQt with. It is also the only
# one of the two that works unaided on a distribution whose Python is externally managed
# (PEP 668) -- `pip install --user` is refused outright on Arch.
#
# `--force` because the point of this target is to take over from whatever is answering now,
# and the usual case is a release binary that pipx did not put there and will not replace on
# its own. pipx puts its entry point in ~/.local/bin, which is where that binary is, so after
# this the name resolves to the checkout.
