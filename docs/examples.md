# Examples

These are complete, worked applications expressed in the SynQt programming model.
They show every artifact a developer writes: contracts, configuration, server
implementations, and client views. They do not show framework internals. Each
example builds on the previous one.

Examples 1 to 3 are single edge systems (a client and a web edge): the edge owns
its state in memory. They use `Client` to reach the calling browser session, which
is the web edge alias for the general `Caller` accessor described in
[the programming model](programming-model.md#reaching-the-caller-the-caller-accessor).
Example 4 adds a third entity, a database, and shows the mesh: the edge authorizes
the user, then calls the database, which authorizes the edge. Example 5 keeps that
three-entity shape and adds [remote pages](remote-pages.md): views the web edge
delivers on demand rather than compiling into the client bundle.

Four of these ship as whole projects rather than as listings. `synqt examples` names them,
and `synqt new shop --example stall` copies one into a project of your own to run and take
apart; the [quick start](quick-start.md) does exactly that.

## Example 1: a shared live counter (no login)

The smallest non trivial app: a counter every connected client sees update in
real time. It demonstrates state shared by every browser, an edge owned property, and
a client to edge request.

### Configuration, `synqt.yaml`

```yaml
project:
  name: counter
  version: 0.1.0
  qt_version: 6.12.0

entities:
  - name: app
    type: client

  - name: edge
    type: web_edge
    public:
      port: 8443

connect_points:
  - owner: edge               # the edge holds the authoritative Source
    consumers: [app]          # the browser may acquire it
    server: web/edge/Edge.qml
    export: |
      prop int value          // edge owned; clients read, edge writes
      slot increment()        // a request; the edge performs the change
      slot decrement()
    # the edge is shared (the default), so one Source holds one number for every
    # browser watching, and each slot still arrives with its own Caller.
    # no scope: any session may use it
```

No `identity` section, so every connection runs at the default anonymous scope.

This config is the development shape: `synqt dev` serves it plaintext on
localhost. A release build is refused without TLS, so running it with
`synqt serve` also needs a `tls` section on the web entity with a
certificate, as Example 2 shows (see the
[validation rules](project-layout-and-config.md#validation)).

### The edge, `web/edge/Edge.qml`

One file is the entity and the surface it exports. The edge is shared, so there is one
of it holding one number however many browsers are watching, and every slot still has a
`Caller` to authorize.

```qml
import SynQt

Edge {
    id: counter

    value: 0

    function increment() { counter.value = counter.value + 1; }   // the edge is the writer
    function decrement() { counter.value = counter.value - 1; }
}
```

Because `value` is a contract property, the framework pushes every change to all
replicas. No broadcast code is needed.

### Client, `client/app/Main.qml`

```qml
import SynQt
import QtQuick.Controls

ApplicationWindow {
    visible: true
    title: "Counter"

    Column {
        anchors.centerIn: parent
        spacing: 12

        Label {
            text: Session.state === "connected" ? ("Value: " + Server.value)
                                                : "Connecting..."
            font.pixelSize: 28
        }

        Row {
            spacing: 8
            Button { text: "-"; onClicked: Server.decrement() }
            Button { text: "+"; onClicked: Server.increment() }
        }
    }
}
```

Open the page in two browser tabs and the counter stays in sync: both tabs mirror the one
Source the edge holds.

## Example 2: the authenticated Todo app

This is the canonical SynQt example: a shared todo list where anyone may read,
but only signed in users may add, and a user may only remove their own items.
Moderators may remove anything. It demonstrates login, scopes, per row ownership
that never leaves the edge, and an edge to client refusal channel.

### Configuration, `synqt.yaml`

Note what is absent from the model role list below: there is no `ownerId`. The edge
will keep an owner id per row for authorization, and it will never reach any
client because it is not a declared role.

```yaml
project:
  name: todo
  version: 0.1.0
  qt_version: 6.12.0

scopes:
  order: [anonymous, user, moderator, admin]
  hierarchical: true
  default: anonymous

entities:
  - name: app
    type: client

  - name: edge
    type: web_edge
    public:
      port: 8443
    tls:
      cert_file: certs/fullchain.pem
      key_file: certs/privkey.pem
    env:
      file: web/edge/.env

identity:
  required: false                 # anonymous users may read; only writing needs a scope
  login: /auth/login
  callback: /auth/callback
  providers:
    - name: github
      authorize_url: https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
      token_url: https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
      userinfo_url: https://api.github.com/user
      client_id: your-github-client-id
      client_secret: env:GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
      scopes: [read:user, user:email]
  mapping:
    hook: web/edge/identity/map.qml

connect_points:
  - owner: edge
    consumers: [app]
    server: web/edge/Edge.qml
    export: |
      prop int count                        // number of items, edge owned
      model items(string[280] text, string[80] author, bool done)  // only these cross
      slot add(string[280] text)
      slot remove(int index)
      signal rejected(string[120] reason)   // the edge explains a refusal to one client
    # the edge is shared (the default), so one Source holds the one list everybody
    # sees, and each slot still arrives with its own Caller.
    # no scope on the connect point: anonymous users may acquire it and read.
    # write permission is enforced inside the slots, not at acquisition.
```

`web/edge/.env` (edge only, never shipped):

```text
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=the-real-secret-value
```

### Identity mapping, `web/edge/identity/map.qml`

This optional hook turns a provider identity into a SynQt scope after login. It
runs only on the edge.

```qml
import SynQt

IdentityMapping {
    // Return the scope a freshly authenticated identity should hold, as a member of the
    // Scope enum SynQt generates from scopes.order beside this file.
    function scopeFor(identity): int {
        const admins      = ["owner@example.com"]
        const moderators  = ["mod@example.com"]
        if (admins.indexOf(identity.email) !== -1)     return Scope.Admin
        if (moderators.indexOf(identity.email) !== -1) return Scope.Moderator
        return Scope.User   // any successfully authenticated user
    }
}
```

### The edge, `web/edge/Edge.qml`

One file is the entity and the surface it exports. The list is one list for the whole
app, and each slot still arrives with its own `Client` (the browser-side name for
`Caller`). `ownerId` is kept on each row and is not a declared model role, so it cannot
reach a browser however the file is written.

```qml
import SynQt

Edge {
    id: todo

    property var rows: []

    count: todo.rows.length

    function add(text) {
        if (!Client.hasScope("user")) {
            Client.emitRejected("Sign in to add items.")
            return
        }
        const clean = ("" + text).trim()
        if (clean.length === 0 || clean.length > 280) {
            Client.emitRejected("Items must be 1 to 280 characters.")
            return
        }
        todo.rows = todo.rows.concat([{
            text: clean,
            author: Client.identity.email,
            done: false,
            ownerId: Client.id              // edge only authorization data
        }])
    }

    function remove(index) {
        if (index < 0 || index >= todo.rows.length) {
            Client.emitRejected("No such item.")
            return
        }
        const row = todo.rows[index]
        const isOwner = row.ownerId === Client.id
        if (!isOwner && !Client.hasScope("moderator")) {
            Client.emitRejected("You can only remove your own items.")
            return
        }
        const next = todo.rows.slice()
        next.splice(index, 1)
        todo.rows = next
    }

    // One binding, so a change any user makes reaches every browser watching.
    // `itemsRows` keeps only the roles `items` declares, so ownerId is dropped at this
    // boundary and never crosses to a browser.
    itemsRows: todo.rows
}
```

### Client, `client/app/Main.qml`

```qml
import SynQt
import QtQuick.Controls
import QtQuick.Layouts

ApplicationWindow {
    visible: true
    width: 360; height: 480
    title: "Todo"

    header: ToolBar {
        RowLayout {
            anchors.fill: parent
            Label { text: "Todo"; Layout.fillWidth: true }
            Button {
                text: Session.identity ? Session.identity.email : "Sign in"
                onClicked: if (!Session.identity) Session.login()   // sends browser to /auth/login
            }
        }
    }

    ColumnLayout {
        anchors.fill: parent
        anchors.margins: 10
        spacing: 8

        Label { text: "Items: " + (Server.count || 0) }

        ListView {
            Layout.fillWidth: true
            Layout.fillHeight: true
            model: Server.items
            delegate: RowLayout {
                width: ListView.view.width
                CheckBox { checked: model.done; enabled: false }
                Label { text: model.text + "  (" + model.author + ")"; Layout.fillWidth: true }
                Button {
                    text: "Remove"
                    // UX hint only; the edge enforces ownership regardless.
                    visible: Session.hasScope("user")
                    onClicked: Server.remove(index)
                }
            }
        }

        RowLayout {
            Layout.fillWidth: true
            TextField {
                id: input
                Layout.fillWidth: true
                placeholderText: "New item"
                enabled: Session.hasScope("user")
            }
            Button {
                text: "Add"
                enabled: Session.hasScope("user") && input.text.trim().length > 0
                onClicked: { Server.add(input.text); input.text = "" }
            }
        }
    }

    // The edge's refusal channel: show why an action was rejected.
    Edge.onRejected: reason => { toast.text = reason; toast.open() }

    Popup { id: toast; property alias text: msg.text; Label { id: msg } }
}
```

### What this example demonstrates

- The client treats `add` and `remove` as requests. The edge authorizes them.
- `ownerId` exists on every row for authorization and never crosses the boundary,
  because it is not a declared model role.
- Client side `Session.hasScope("user")` only hides and disables UI. A modified
  client that calls `Server.add` while anonymous still hits an edge that
  refuses, with `rejected("Sign in to add items.")`.
- Ownership is enforced with an edge side value the client cannot spoof, never with
  anything the client sends. Here that value is `Client.id`, the session identifier;
  `Client` is the edge alias for the `Caller` accessor, so this is the same mechanism
  the mesh example (Example 4) writes as `Caller`. A session id is enough for this in
  memory list, where the data lives only as long as the edge process. Durable rows
  key ownership on `Caller.identity.sub` instead (see Example 4), so ownership
  survives a new session and a restart.
- The whole login exchange (the GitHub redirect, the code exchange with the
  client secret, the session cookie) happens on the edge. The browser only ever
  holds the opaque session cookie.

## Example 3: a private per session draft (sketch)

What makes a draft private is `shared: false` on the entity, which gives each caller a
Source of its own, plus a scope on the point so an anonymous client never acquires it at
all:

```yaml
entities:
  - name: edge
    type: web_edge
    shared: false             # a draft Source per session

connect_points:
  - owner: edge
    consumers: [app]
    server: web/edge/Edge.qml
    scope: user               # only signed in users may acquire it at all
    export: |
      prop string[4000] body
      slot save(string[4000] text)
```

One user's draft is a different Source instance from another's, so there is nothing
through which one client could observe another's. The `scope: user` precondition means an
anonymous client never even acquires the replica.

## Example 4: a three entity todo with durable storage

This is the canonical mesh example. A browser client, a web edge, and a database
entity. The edge owns the user facing connect point and authorizes the user; the
database owns durable storage and authorizes the edge. Items survive a restart
because they live in the database entity, not in edge memory.

### Topology, `synqt.yaml`

```yaml
project:
  name: todo
  version: 0.1.0
  qt_version: 6.12.0

scopes:
  order: [anonymous, user, moderator, admin]
  hierarchical: true
  default: anonymous

entities:
  - name: app
    type: client

  - name: edge
    type: web_edge
    public:
      host: 0.0.0.0
      port: 8443
    tls:
      cert_file: certs/edge/fullchain.pem
      key_file: certs/edge/privkey.pem
    mesh:
      transport: mtls            # the default: mutual TLS, over loopback on one host
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 9443
    env:
      file: web/edge/.env

  - name: store
    type: relational
    mesh:
      transport: mtls            # certificate identity: the database can trust Caller.entity
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 9444
    settings:
      file: db/relational/store/data/app.db
      journal_mode: wal
      busy_timeout_ms: 5000

connect_points:
  - owner: edge               # the edge owns the user facing object
    consumers: [app]          # the browser may acquire it
    server: web/edge/Edge.qml
    export: |
      model items(string[280] text, string[80] author, bool done)  // only these cross
      slot add(string[280] text)
      slot remove(int index)
      signal rejected(string[120] reason)
    # the edge is shared (the default): one Source, and each slot still arrives
    # with its own Caller

  - owner: store              # the store entity owns durable storage
    consumers: [edge]         # only the edge may reach it; never the browser
    server: db/relational/store/Store.qml
    export: |
      record ItemRow(string[280] text, string[80] author, string[64] ownerSub)
      slot var list()                  // rows { id, text, author, ownerSub } to the edge
      slot insert(ItemRow row)
      slot remove(int id)
      signal changed()                 // tells the edge the data moved
```

Auth is added with `synqt add auth github` (see [authentication](authentication.md)); omitted here for focus.

The mesh link is mutual TLS even though both entities share a host, so the one entity on
its consumer list is the one its certificate proves it to be. `synqt mesh cert --all`
issues the certificates for deployment; `synqt dev` provisions throwaway development ones
automatically.

Note below that `ownerSub` exists on the store entity's point (the edge needs it to
enforce ownership) but is absent from the edge's `items` roles, so it never reaches the
browser.

### The database entity, `db/relational/store/Store.qml`

```qml
import SynQt

Store {
    id: items

    // Nothing here asks who is calling: the consumer list has one name in it, so the
    // mesh opens no link to anything else and nothing else can acquire this.
    function list() {
        return Db.query("SELECT id, text, author, owner_sub AS ownerSub"
                        + " FROM items ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 200")
    }

    function insert(row) {
        Db.exec("INSERT INTO items(text, author, owner_sub) VALUES(?, ?, ?)",
                [row.text, row.author, row.ownerSub])   // parameterized: no injection
        items.changed()                                  // notify the edge
    }

    function remove(id) {
        Db.exec("DELETE FROM items WHERE id = ?", [id])
        items.changed()
    }
}
```

`db/relational/store/schema.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS items (
    id        INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    text      TEXT NOT NULL,
    author    TEXT NOT NULL,
    owner_sub TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### The web edge, `web/edge/Edge.qml`

```qml
import SynQt

Edge {
    id: todo

    // The last fetched internal rows (id and ownerSub included): edge memory only,
    // used to authorize removals. Never a model role, so it never reaches a browser.
    property var rows: []

    // Keep the browser facing model in sync with the database.
    function refresh() {
        // list() returns a value, so this cross entity call resolves asynchronously.
        Store.list().then(fetched => {
            todo.rows = fetched
            // Map internal rows to the browser facing roles (drop id and ownerSub).
            todo.setItems(fetched.map(r => ({ text: r.text, author: r.author, done: false })))
        })
    }

    Component.onCompleted: refresh()

    Store.onChanged: todo.refresh()   // the database moved; repull

    function add(text) {
        // The edge authorizes the user.
        if (!Caller.hasScope("user")) { Caller.emitRejected("Sign in to add items."); return }
        const clean = ("" + text).trim()
        if (clean.length === 0 || clean.length > 280) {
            Caller.emitRejected("Items must be 1 to 280 characters."); return
        }
        // Persist via the database entity. The database authorizes that the caller is the edge.
        Store.insert({ text: clean, author: Caller.identity.email,
                                ownerSub: Caller.identity.sub })
    }

    function remove(index) {
        if (index < 0 || index >= rows.length) {
            Caller.emitRejected("No such item."); return
        }
        // Ownership is decided against the verified identity, never a client value:
        // a user removes only rows whose ownerSub matches their own sub; a moderator
        // removes any.
        const row = rows[index]
        const isOwner = Caller.identity && row.ownerSub === Caller.identity.sub
        if (!isOwner && !Caller.hasScope("moderator")) {
            Caller.emitRejected("You can only remove your own items."); return
        }
        // The database authorizes that the caller is the edge, then deletes by id.
        Store.remove(row.id)
    }
}
```

### The client, `client/app/Main.qml`

Identical in spirit to Example 2: it reads `Server.items`, calls
`Server.add(...)` and `Server.remove(index)`, and shows the reason a refusal
carries through `Edge.onRejected`. The client does
not know a database exists; it only ever talks to the edge.

### What this example demonstrates

- Three entities, two boundaries. The edge authorizes the user (the scope on the member,
  and `Caller` for the rest); the topology puts the database out of the browser's reach by
  listing one consumer.
- The full user authorization matrix lives on the edge: anonymous cannot add, a
  user removes only rows whose `ownerSub` matches their own `Caller.identity.sub`,
  a moderator removes any. No client supplied value participates in the ownership
  decision; the edge compares its own cached `ownerSub` against the verified
  identity.
- The browser cannot reach the store. Its point lists only `edge` as a consumer, and
  the browser cannot physically reach a non edge entity anyway.
- Data minimization across two hops. `ownerSub` is on the internal contract for the
  edge's ownership logic and is dropped before anything reaches the browser, because
  it is not one of the edge's `items` roles. It carries `Caller.identity.sub`, the stable
  identity subject, rather than the session id (`Client.id`) that Example 2 used:
  the accessor is the same one Example 2 reaches through the `Client` alias, but a
  durable row must stay owned across new sessions and restarts, so it keys on the
  identity rather than the session.
- Durability without a third party database server. Items live in the persistence
  entity's embedded store and survive restarts. No separate database product is run,
  configured, or secured; it is a SynQt entity in the same toolchain and security
  model.
- The same connect point mechanism carries both links. `Server` (browser to
  edge over wss) and `Store.items` (edge to database over the mesh) are the same
  programming model with different transports underneath.

## Example 5: a storefront with edge-delivered campaign pages

The [`stall`](https://github.com/Kidev/SynQt/tree/main/examples/stall) example is the
three-entity shape of Example 4 (a browser client, a web edge, and a `stock` database
the browser reaches only through the edge) with one thing added: its marketing
campaign pages are [remote pages](remote-pages.md), delivered by the edge on demand
rather than compiled into the client bundle. The product grid and the cart ship in the
bundle; a merchandiser changes a campaign, or adds a new one, without a client rebuild.

### Topology, `synqt.yaml`

The entities are a `type: client`, a `type: web_edge`, and a
`type: relational` database. The route table and the `router` block are
top-level keys:

```yaml
routes:
  - path: /
    view: Home.qml            # compiled into the client bundle
  - path: /cart
    view: Cart.qml

  - path: /c/:campaign
    remote: Campaign.qml      # delivered by the edge, from web/edge/pages/Campaign.qml
    seed: web/edge/campaign-seed.qml
  - path: /members
    remote: Members.qml       # delivered by the edge, and members only
    scope: user

router:
  fallback: /
  base: /
  palette: [QtQuick, QtQuick.Layouts]   # what a delivered page may import

connect_points:

### The delivered page, `web/edge/pages/Campaign.qml`

One file serves every slug. Its root is an `Item`, not a window, because a delivered
page is loaded into the client's `Loader`, and it imports only the palette modules. It
paints its headline from the seed on the first frame, then keeps the offers live
through the `catalog` replica:

```qml
import QtQuick
import QtQuick.Layouts

Item {
    id: campaign

    readonly property string headline: Router.pageSeed.headline ?? "Today's offers"

    ColumnLayout {
        anchors.fill: parent
        anchors.margins: 16
        spacing: 12

        Text {
            text: campaign.headline
            font.pixelSize: 24
            Layout.fillWidth: true
            wrapMode: Text.WordWrap
        }

        ListView {
            Layout.fillWidth: true
            Layout.fillHeight: true
            clip: true
            model: Server.offers
            delegate: Text {
                required property string title
                required property int price
                width: ListView.view.width
                text: title + "  -  " + price
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### The page seed, `web/edge/campaign-seed.qml`

The seed runs on the edge, after the route's scope check, and turns the slug into the
headline the page paints first, so it never flashes empty:

```qml
import SynQt

PageSeed {
    // Leave the parameters untyped: the edge invokes this hook generically, passing
    // every argument as a QVariant, so annotating one (route: string) would change the
    // method signature and the edge would silently deliver the page with no seed. The
    // return may be annotated var.
    function seedFor(route, parameters, caller): var {
        const slug = parameters.campaign ?? "";
        const words = slug.split("-").filter(part => part.length > 0);
        const headline = words
            .map(part => part.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + part.slice(1))
            .join(" ");
        return { headline: headline.length > 0 ? headline : "Today's offers" };
    }
}
```

### What this example demonstrates

- A route is compiled in (`view:`) or edge-delivered (`remote:`). The campaign and
  members pages are `remote:`, so they never enter the bundle and change without a
  client rebuild.
- `router.palette` is the trust boundary for a delivered page: the whole set of QML
  modules it may import, enforced by the client.
- The page seed paints the first frame. It runs on the edge per request, is keyed on
  the path parameter, and its return is `Router.pageSeed` on the client, so one
  `Campaign.qml` gives every slug its own headline. Its parameters are left untyped so
  the edge's generic invocation matches.
- A delivered page's `scope` protects the page, not the data. `Members.qml` is refused
  to an under-scoped session with no markup, no hash, and no seed, but the data any
  page reads is still governed by the connect point's own scope.
- The database stays unreachable from the browser. The stock entity's connect point is
  owned by `stock` and consumed only by `edge`; adding the client as a consumer fails
  `synqt check`, because the browser can only reach a web edge.
