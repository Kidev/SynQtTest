# Examples

These are complete, worked applications expressed in the SynQt programming model.
They show every artifact a developer writes: contracts, configuration, server
implementations, and client views. They do not show framework internals. Each
example builds on the previous one.

Examples 1 to 3 are single edge systems (a client and a web edge): the edge owns
its state in memory. They use `Client` to reach the calling browser session, which
is the web edge alias for the general `Caller` accessor described in
[the programming model](programming-model.md#reaching-the-caller-the-caller-accessor).
Example 4 adds a third entity, a database, and shows the mesh: the edge authorizes
the user, then calls the database, which authorizes the edge. Example 5 keeps that
three-entity shape and adds [remote pages](remote-pages.md): views the web edge
delivers on demand rather than compiling into the client bundle.

## Example 1: a shared live counter (no login)

The smallest non trivial app: a counter every connected client sees update in
real time. It demonstrates state shared by every browser, an edge owned property, and
a client to edge request.

### Contract, `web/edge/Counter.syn`

```syn
contract Counter {
    prop int value          // edge owned; clients read, edge writes
    slot increment()        // a request; the edge performs the change
    slot decrement()
}
```

### Configuration, `synqt.yaml`

```yaml
project:
  name: counter
  version: 0.1.0
  qt_version: 6.11.1

entities:
  - name: app
    type: client

  - name: edge
    type: web_edge
    public:
      port: 8443

connect_points:
  - name: counter
    owner: edge               # the edge holds the authoritative Source
    consumers: [app]          # the browser may acquire it
    server: web/edge/Counter.qml
    # no instance: one Source per caller is the default, so each session gets its
    # own Source and each slot gets its Caller. The counter itself is one number for
    # everybody, so it lives in the edge entity's own file below.
    # no scope: any session may use it
```

No `identity` section, so every connection runs at the default anonymous scope.

This config is the development shape: `synqt dev` serves it plaintext on
localhost. A release build refuses to start without TLS, so running it with
`synqt serve` also needs a `tls` section on the web entity with a
certificate, as Example 2 shows (see the
[validation rules](project-layout-and-config.md#validation)).

### The edge entity, `web/edge/Edge.qml`

The number itself, held by the entity rather than by any one connection. A Source is
created per browser session and does not outlive it; this file is the entity and does.

```qml
pragma Singleton

import QtQuick

QtObject {
    id: root

    property int value: 0

    function bump(by: int) {
        root.value = root.value + by;
    }
}
```

### Edge, `web/edge/Counter.qml`

One of these per browser session. It binds the contract property to the entity's number,
so every session sees the same value and every slot still has a `Caller` to authorize.

```qml
import QtQuick
import SynQt

Counter {
    id: counter

    value: Edge.value

    function increment() { Edge.bump(1); }    // the edge is the writer
    function decrement() { Edge.bump(-1); }
}
```

Because `value` is a contract property, the framework pushes every change to all
replicas. No broadcast code is needed.

### Client, `client/app/Main.qml`

```qml
import QtQuick
import QtQuick.Controls
import SynQt

ApplicationWindow {
    visible: true
    title: "Counter"

    Column {
        anchors.centerIn: parent
        spacing: 12

        Label {
            text: Session.state === "connected" ? ("Value: " + Server.counter.value)
                                                : "Connecting..."
            font.pixelSize: 28
        }

        Row {
            spacing: 8
            Button { text: "-"; onClicked: Server.counter.decrement() }
            Button { text: "+"; onClicked: Server.counter.increment() }
        }
    }
}
```

Open the page in two browser tabs and the counter stays in sync: each tab has its own
Source, and both bind to the one number the edge entity holds.

## Example 2: the authenticated Todo app

This is the canonical SynQt example: a shared todo list where anyone may read,
but only signed in users may add, and a user may only remove their own items.
Moderators may remove anything. It demonstrates login, scopes, per row ownership
that never leaves the edge, and an edge to client refusal channel.

### Contract, `web/edge/Todo.syn`

```syn
contract Todo {
    prop int count                          // number of items, edge owned
    model items(string text, string author, bool done)   // only these cross to clients
    slot add(string text)
    slot remove(int index)
    signal rejected(string reason)          // the edge explains a refusal to one client
}
```

Note what is absent from the model role list: there is no `ownerId`. The edge
will keep an owner id per row for authorization, and it will never reach any
client because it is not a declared role.

### Configuration, `synqt.yaml`

```yaml
project:
  name: todo
  version: 0.1.0
  qt_version: 6.11.1

scopes:
  order: [anonymous, user, moderator, admin]
  hierarchical: true
  default: anonymous

entities:
  - name: app
    type: client

  - name: edge
    type: web_edge
    public:
      port: 8443
    tls:
      cert_file: certs/fullchain.pem
      key_file: certs/privkey.pem
    env:
      file: web/edge/.env

identity:
  required: false                 # anonymous users may read; only writing needs a scope
  login: /auth/login
  callback: /auth/callback
  providers:
    - name: github
      authorize_url: https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
      token_url: https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
      userinfo_url: https://api.github.com/user
      client_id: your-github-client-id
      client_secret: env:GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
      scopes: [read:user, user:email]
  mapping:
    hook: web/edge/identity/map.qml

connect_points:
  - name: todo
    owner: edge
    consumers: [app]
    server: web/edge/Todo.qml
    # no instance: caller, so each slot has its Caller. The list everyone sees
    # lives in the edge entity's own file, which outlives any one connection.
    # no scope on the connect point: anonymous users may acquire it and read.
    # write permission is enforced inside the slots, not at acquisition.
```

`web/edge/.env` (edge only, never shipped):

```cli
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=the-real-secret-value
```

### Identity mapping, `web/edge/identity/map.qml`

This optional hook turns a provider identity into a SynQt scope after login. It
runs only on the edge.

```qml
import QtQuick
import SynQt

IdentityMapping {
    // Return the scope a freshly authenticated identity should hold.
    function scopeFor(identity) {
        const admins      = ["hello@iamki.dev"]
        const moderators  = ["mod@example.com"]
        if (admins.indexOf(identity.email) !== -1)     return "admin"
        if (moderators.indexOf(identity.email) !== -1) return "moderator"
        return "user"   // any successfully authenticated user
    }
}
```

### The edge entity, `web/edge/Edge.qml`

The list is one list for the whole app, so it belongs to the entity and not to any one
connection. `ownerId` is kept here and is not declared in the contract, so it cannot reach
a browser however the Source is written.

```qml
pragma Singleton

import QtQuick

QtObject {
    id: root

    property var rows: []

    function append(row) {
        root.rows = root.rows.concat([row]);
    }

    function removeAt(index: int) {
        const next = root.rows.slice();
        next.splice(index, 1);
        root.rows = next;
    }
}
```

### Edge, `web/edge/Todo.qml`

One of these per browser session, which is what gives every slot below its `Client`
(the browser-side name for `Caller`). It reads and writes the entity's list, and
`setItems` copies only the declared roles out to that session.

```qml
import QtQuick
import SynQt

Todo {
    id: todo

    count: Edge.rows.length

    function add(text) {
        if (!Client.hasScope("user")) {
            Client.emitRejected("Sign in to add items.")
            return
        }
        const clean = ("" + text).trim()
        if (clean.length === 0 || clean.length > 280) {
            Client.emitRejected("Items must be 1 to 280 characters.")
            return
        }
        Edge.append({
            text: clean,
            author: Client.identity.email,
            done: false,
            ownerId: Client.id              // edge only authorization data
        })
    }

    function remove(index) {
        if (index < 0 || index >= Edge.rows.length) {
            Client.emitRejected("No such item.")
            return
        }
        const row = Edge.rows[index]
        const isOwner = row.ownerId === Client.id
        if (!isOwner && !Client.hasScope("moderator")) {
            Client.emitRejected("You can only remove your own items.")
            return
        }
        Edge.removeAt(index)
    }

    // Every session's Source republishes when the entity's list changes, so a change one
    // user makes reaches all of them. setItems keeps only the roles `items` declares, so
    // ownerId is dropped at this boundary and never crosses to a browser.
    Component.onCompleted: todo.setItems(Edge.rows)

    Connections {
        function onRowsChanged() {
            todo.setItems(Edge.rows);
        }

        target: Edge
    }
}
```

### Client, `client/app/Main.qml`

```qml
import QtQuick
import QtQuick.Controls
import QtQuick.Layouts
import SynQt

ApplicationWindow {
    visible: true
    width: 360; height: 480
    title: "Todo"

    header: ToolBar {
        RowLayout {
            anchors.fill: parent
            Label { text: "Todo"; Layout.fillWidth: true }
            Button {
                text: Session.identity ? Session.identity.email : "Sign in"
                onClicked: if (!Session.identity) Session.login()   // sends browser to /auth/login
            }
        }
    }

    ColumnLayout {
        anchors.fill: parent
        anchors.margins: 10
        spacing: 8

        Label { text: "Items: " + (Server.todo.count || 0) }

        ListView {
            Layout.fillWidth: true
            Layout.fillHeight: true
            model: Server.todo.items
            delegate: RowLayout {
                width: ListView.view.width
                CheckBox { checked: model.done; enabled: false }
                Label { text: model.text + "  (" + model.author + ")"; Layout.fillWidth: true }
                Button {
                    text: "Remove"
                    // UX hint only; the edge enforces ownership regardless.
                    visible: Session.hasScope("user")
                    onClicked: Server.todo.remove(index)
                }
            }
        }

        RowLayout {
            Layout.fillWidth: true
            TextField {
                id: input
                Layout.fillWidth: true
                placeholderText: "New item"
                enabled: Session.hasScope("user")
            }
            Button {
                text: "Add"
                enabled: Session.hasScope("user") && input.text.trim().length > 0
                onClicked: { Server.todo.add(input.text); input.text = "" }
            }
        }
    }

    // The edge's refusal channel: show why an action was rejected.
    Todo.onRejected: reason => { toast.text = reason; toast.open() }

    Popup { id: toast; property alias text: msg.text; Label { id: msg } }
}
```

### What this example demonstrates

- The client treats `add` and `remove` as requests. The edge authorizes them.
- `ownerId` exists on every row for authorization and never crosses the boundary,
  because it is not a declared model role. Confidentiality is structural.
- Client side `Session.hasScope("user")` only hides and disables UI. A modified
  client that calls `Server.todo.add` while anonymous still hits an edge that
  refuses, with `rejected("Sign in to add items.")`.
- Ownership is enforced with an edge side value the client cannot spoof, never with
  anything the client sends. Here that value is `Client.id`, the session identifier;
  `Client` is the edge alias for the `Caller` accessor, so this is the same mechanism
  the mesh example (Example 4) writes as `Caller`. A session id is enough for this in
  memory list, where the data lives only as long as the edge process. Durable rows
  key ownership on `Caller.identity.sub` instead (see Example 4), so ownership
  survives a new session and a restart.
- The whole login exchange (the GitHub redirect, the code exchange with the
  client secret, the session cookie) happens on the edge. The browser only ever
  holds the opaque session cookie.

## Example 3: a private per session draft (sketch)

Every connect point already gets a Source per caller. What makes a draft private is that
the Source keeps its state to itself instead of reading the entity's, and that the point is
scoped so an anonymous client never acquires it at all:

```yaml
connect_points:
  - name: draft
    owner: edge
    consumers: [app]
    server: web/edge/Draft.qml
    scope: user               # only signed in users may acquire it at all
    instance: caller     # each session has its own draft Source
```

One user's draft is a different Source instance from another's, and this one touches no
singleton, so there is nothing through which one client could observe another's draft. The
`scope: user` precondition means an anonymous client never even acquires the replica.

## Example 4: a three entity todo with durable storage

This is the canonical mesh example. A browser client, a web edge, and a database
entity. The edge owns the user facing connect point and authorizes the user; the
database owns durable storage and authorizes the edge. Items survive a restart
because they live in the database entity, not in edge memory.

### Topology, `synqt.yaml`

```yaml
project:
  name: todo
  version: 0.1.0
  qt_version: 6.11.1

scopes:
  order: [anonymous, user, moderator, admin]
  hierarchical: true
  default: anonymous

entities:
  - name: app
    type: client

  - name: edge
    type: web_edge
    public:
      host: 0.0.0.0
      port: 8443
    tls:
      cert_file: certs/edge/fullchain.pem
      key_file: certs/edge/privkey.pem
    mesh:
      transport: mtls            # the default: mutual TLS, over loopback on one host
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 9443
    env:
      file: web/edge/.env

  - name: store
    type: relational
    mesh:
      transport: mtls            # certificate identity: the database can trust Caller.entity
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 9444
    settings:
      file: db/relational/store/data/app.db
      journal_mode: wal
      busy_timeout_ms: 5000

connect_points:
  - name: todo
    owner: edge               # the edge owns the user facing object
    consumers: [app]          # the browser may acquire it
    server: web/edge/Todo.qml
    # no instance: one Source per caller is the default, which is what gives
    # the slots below their Caller

  - name: items
    owner: store              # the store entity owns durable storage
    consumers: [edge]         # only the edge may reach it; never the browser
    server: db/relational/store/Items.qml
    # no instance: one Source per calling entity, so Caller.entity is
    # the verified name of the entity that called
```

Auth is added with `synqt add auth github` (see [authentication](authentication.md)); omitted here for focus.

The mesh link is mutual TLS even though both entities share a host, so the
database's `Caller.entity` check below rests on a verified certificate.
`synqt mesh cert --all` issues the certificates for deployment; `synqt dev`
provisions throwaway development ones automatically.

### Contracts

`web/edge/Todo.syn` (browser facing, owned by the edge):

```syn
contract Todo {
    model items(string text, string author, bool done)   // only these cross to the browser
    slot add(string text)
    slot remove(int index)
    signal rejected(string reason)
}
```

`db/relational/store/Items.syn` (internal, owned by the database, consumed by the edge):

```syn
contract Items {
    slot var list()                    // rows { id, text, author, ownerSub } to the edge
    slot insert(ItemRow row)
    slot remove(int id)
    signal changed()                   // tells the edge the data moved
}

record ItemRow(string text, string author, string ownerSub)
```

Note `ownerSub` exists on the internal contract (the edge needs it to enforce
ownership) but is absent from `Todo.items` roles, so it never reaches the browser.

### The database entity, `db/relational/store/Items.qml`

```qml
import QtQuick
import SynQt

Items {
    id: items

    function list() {
        // Only the edge may read. Authorize the calling entity.
        if (Caller.entity !== "edge") return []
        return Db.query("SELECT id, text, author, owner_sub AS ownerSub"
                        + " FROM items ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 200")
    }

    function insert(row) {
        if (Caller.entity !== "edge") return
        Db.exec("INSERT INTO items(text, author, owner_sub) VALUES(?, ?, ?)",
                [row.text, row.author, row.ownerSub])   // parameterized: no injection
        items.changed()                                  // notify the edge
    }

    function remove(id) {
        if (Caller.entity !== "edge") return
        Db.exec("DELETE FROM items WHERE id = ?", [id])
        items.changed()
    }
}
```

`db/relational/store/schema.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS items (
    id        INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    text      TEXT NOT NULL,
    author    TEXT NOT NULL,
    owner_sub TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### The web edge, `web/edge/Todo.qml`

```qml
import QtQuick
import SynQt

Todo {
    id: todo

    // The last fetched internal rows (id and ownerSub included): edge memory only,
    // used to authorize removals. Never a model role, so it never reaches a browser.
    property var rows: []

    // Keep the browser facing model in sync with the database.
    function refresh() {
        // list() returns a value, so this cross entity call resolves asynchronously.
        Store.items.list().then(fetched => {
            todo.rows = fetched
            // Map internal rows to the browser facing roles (drop id and ownerSub).
            todo.setItems(fetched.map(r => ({ text: r.text, author: r.author, done: false })))
        })
    }

    Component.onCompleted: refresh()

    Items.onChanged: todo.refresh()   // the database moved; repull

    function add(text) {
        // The edge authorizes the user.
        if (!Caller.hasScope("user")) { Caller.emitRejected("Sign in to add items."); return }
        const clean = ("" + text).trim()
        if (clean.length === 0 || clean.length > 280) {
            Caller.emitRejected("Items must be 1 to 280 characters."); return
        }
        // Persist via the database entity. The database authorizes that the caller is the edge.
        Store.items.insert({ text: clean, author: Caller.identity.email,
                                ownerSub: Caller.identity.sub })
    }

    function remove(index) {
        if (index < 0 || index >= rows.length) {
            Caller.emitRejected("No such item."); return
        }
        // Ownership is decided against the verified identity, never a client value:
        // a user removes only rows whose ownerSub matches their own sub; a moderator
        // removes any.
        const row = rows[index]
        const isOwner = Caller.identity && row.ownerSub === Caller.identity.sub
        if (!isOwner && !Caller.hasScope("moderator")) {
            Caller.emitRejected("You can only remove your own items."); return
        }
        // The database authorizes that the caller is the edge, then deletes by id.
        Store.items.remove(row.id)
    }
}
```

### The client, `client/app/Main.qml`

Identical in spirit to Example 2: it reads `Server.todo.items`, calls
`Server.todo.add(...)` and `Server.todo.remove(index)`, and shows
`Server.todo.rejected` reasons. The client does
not know a database exists; it only ever talks to the edge.

### What this example demonstrates

- Three entities, two trust boundaries. The edge authorizes the user
  (`Caller.hasScope`), the database authorizes the entity (`Caller.entity`). Neither
  trusts the other blindly.
- The full user authorization matrix lives on the edge: anonymous cannot add, a
  user removes only rows whose `ownerSub` matches their own `Caller.identity.sub`,
  a moderator removes any. No client supplied value participates in the ownership
  decision; the edge compares its own cached `ownerSub` against the verified
  identity.
- The browser cannot reach the store. `items` lists only `edge` as a consumer, and
  the browser cannot physically reach a non edge entity anyway.
- Data minimization across two hops. `ownerSub` is on the internal contract for the
  edge's ownership logic and is dropped before anything reaches the browser, because
  it is not a `Todo.items` role. It carries `Caller.identity.sub`, the stable
  identity subject, rather than the session id (`Client.id`) that Example 2 used:
  the accessor is the same one Example 2 reaches through the `Client` alias, but a
  durable row must stay owned across new sessions and restarts, so it keys on the
  identity rather than the session.
- Durability without a third party database server. Items live in the persistence
  entity's embedded store and survive restarts. No separate database product is run,
  configured, or secured; it is a SynQt entity in the same toolchain and security
  model.
- The same connect point mechanism carries both links. `Server.todo` (browser to
  edge over wss) and `Store.items` (edge to database over the mesh) are the same
  programming model with different transports underneath.

## Example 5: a storefront with edge-delivered campaign pages

The [`stall`](https://github.com/Kidev/SynQt/tree/main/examples/stall) example is the
three-entity shape of Example 4 (a browser client, a web edge, and a `stock` database
the browser reaches only through the edge) with one thing added: its marketing
campaign pages are [remote pages](remote-pages.md), delivered by the edge on demand
rather than compiled into the client bundle. The product grid and the cart ship in the
bundle; a merchandiser changes a campaign, or adds a new one, without a client rebuild.

### Topology, `synqt.yaml`

The entities are a `type: client`, a `type: web_edge`, and a
`type: relational` database. The route table and the `router` block are
top-level keys:

```yaml
routes:
  - path: /
    view: Home.qml            # compiled into the client bundle
  - path: /cart
    view: Cart.qml

  - path: /c/:campaign
    remote: Campaign.qml      # delivered by the edge, from web/edge/pages/Campaign.qml
    seed: web/edge/campaign-seed.qml
  - path: /members
    remote: Members.qml       # delivered by the edge, and members only
    scope: user

router:
  fallback: /
  base: /
  palette: [QtQuick, QtQuick.Layouts]   # what a delivered page may import

connect_points:
  - name: catalog
    owner: edge               # the edge owns the browser-facing live catalog
    consumers: [app]
    server: web/edge/Catalog.qml

  - name: inventory
    owner: stock              # the stock entity owns the durable stock
    consumers: [edge]         # only the edge; a client consumer here fails synqt check
    server: db/relational/stock/Inventory.qml
    instance: caller
```

### The delivered page, `web/edge/pages/Campaign.qml`

One file serves every slug. Its root is an `Item`, not a window, because a delivered
page is loaded into the client's `Loader`, and it imports only the palette modules. It
paints its headline from the seed on the first frame, then keeps the offers live
through the `catalog` replica:

```qml
import QtQuick
import QtQuick.Layouts

Item {
    id: campaign

    readonly property string headline: Router.pageSeed.headline ?? "Today's offers"

    ColumnLayout {
        anchors.fill: parent
        anchors.margins: 16
        spacing: 12

        Text {
            text: campaign.headline
            font.pixelSize: 24
            Layout.fillWidth: true
            wrapMode: Text.WordWrap
        }

        ListView {
            Layout.fillWidth: true
            Layout.fillHeight: true
            clip: true
            model: Server.catalog.offers
            delegate: Text {
                required property string title
                required property int price
                width: ListView.view.width
                text: title + "  -  " + price
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### The page seed, `web/edge/campaign-seed.qml`

The seed runs on the edge, after the route's scope check, and turns the slug into the
headline the page paints first, so it never flashes empty:

```qml
import QtQuick
import SynQt

PageSeed {
    // Leave the parameters untyped: the edge invokes this hook generically, passing
    // every argument as a QVariant, so annotating one (route: string) would change the
    // method signature and the edge would silently deliver the page with no seed. The
    // return may be annotated var.
    function seedFor(route, parameters, caller): var {
        const slug = parameters.campaign ?? "";
        const words = slug.split("-").filter(part => part.length > 0);
        const headline = words
            .map(part => part.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + part.slice(1))
            .join(" ");
        return { headline: headline.length > 0 ? headline : "Today's offers" };
    }
}
```

### What this example demonstrates

- A route is compiled in (`view:`) or edge-delivered (`remote:`). The campaign and
  members pages are `remote:`, so they never enter the bundle and change without a
  client rebuild.
- `router.palette` is the trust boundary for a delivered page: the whole set of QML
  modules it may import, enforced by the client.
- The page seed paints the first frame. It runs on the edge per request, is keyed on
  the path parameter, and its return is `Router.pageSeed` on the client, so one
  `Campaign.qml` gives every slug its own headline. Its parameters are left untyped so
  the edge's generic invocation matches.
- A delivered page's `scope` protects the page, not the data. `Members.qml` is refused
  to an under-scoped session with no markup, no hash, and no seed, but the data any
  page reads is still governed by the connect point's own scope.
- The database stays unreachable from the browser. The `inventory` connect point is
  owned by `stock` and consumed only by `edge`; adding the client as a consumer fails
  `synqt check`, because the browser can only reach a web edge.

step and runs the three hands-on checks against it.
