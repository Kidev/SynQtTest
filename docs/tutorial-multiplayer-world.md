# The arena the edge owns

With the [empty scene running](tutorial-multiplayer.md), it is time to give the edge
a world to own. This part declares what crosses the wire, adds a GitHub guest list,
and puts the one authoritative arena, blobs, pellets, and all, in the edge's hands.
Here the edge computes movement itself. Every blob's position is the edge's to decide.

## Step 1: The shared arena (a contract)

One connect point carries the whole game: every blob's pose and size, the pellets on
the map, a request to aim somewhere, and an event when one blob eats another. Create
`web/edge/Arena.syn`:

```syn
// The arena the edge owns and every browser mirrors.
//   model  : one row per item, owner -> consumers (only these fields cross)
//   slot   : a request from a browser to the edge
//   signal : the edge telling browsers something happened
contract Arena {
    // Every player, for drawing.
    model blobs(string id, string name, real x, real y, real mass, bool online)
    model board(string name, real mass)           // the live leaderboard, biggest first
    model pellets(string id, real x, real y)      // food scattered on the map
    slot steer(real x, real y)                    // "I am aiming at this spot" (a goal)
    slot real ping()                              // the edge clock in ms, for latency
    signal eaten(string prey, string predator)    // one blob swallowed another
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Look hard at `steer`. Its two `real` arguments are not where the player *is*; they
> are the point in the world the player is *aiming at*, the spot under their cursor.
> The edge will walk the blob toward that goal at the speed the blob's mass allows,
> and stop it when it arrives. The client never sends a position, so there is no
> position to forge. That single choice, taking intent instead of state, is what
> makes the movement honest, and we will come back to it. `ping` returns a value, so
> calling it is an asynchronous request whose answer arrives later, which is exactly
> what a round trip time needs. The `blobs` model lists six roles and only those six
> cross to a browser; the edge keeps more per player (a GitHub subject id, an aim
> point, timestamps) that never leaves it, because those fields are not in the model.

## Step 2: Only approved players get in

Add GitHub sign in:

```cli
synqt add auth github
```

Follow the same one time GitHub setup as [the auction](tutorial-sign-in.md#step-1-add-authentication):
register an OAuth app, put the Client ID in `synqt.yaml`, and the Client secret in
`web/edge/.env` only. When that is done, anyone can sign in, but signing in is not the
same as being allowed in. The guest list is a scope mapping.

Declare the scopes in `synqt.yaml`:

```yaml
scopes:
  order: [anonymous, player]
  default: anonymous
```

Open the identity mapping hook `synqt add auth` scaffolded, `web/edge/identity/map.qml`,
and grant the `player` scope only to GitHub usernames you approve:

```qml
import QtQuick
import SynQt

IdentityMapping {
    // The guest list. Only these GitHub usernames may enter the arena.
    readonly property var approved: ["octocat", "your-github-username"]

    function scopeFor(identity) {
        if (approved.indexOf(identity.login) !== -1)
            return "player"
        return "anonymous"     // signed in, but not on the guest list
    }
}
```

`identity.login` is the GitHub username; `identity.sub` (used all over the edge
below) is the stable subject id GitHub assigns, which is what keys a player even if
they change their display name. Everyone who signs in gets a real identity, but only
approved logins reach the `player` scope, and the connect point below requires it.

## Step 3: The edge owns the arena, once

Here is the heart of the game. The edge holds the one authoritative arena: the roster
of players (with private bookkeeping the browser never sees), the pellets, and a
simulation loop that moves every blob, feeds it, and resolves who eats whom.

It goes in two files, and which one is which matters. There is exactly one arena however
many people are playing, so the arena lives in the edge entity's own singleton. Each
browser session gets its own connect point Source, which is what gives its slots a
`Caller` to check, and that Source is a thin layer over the one arena. A single Source
shared by everybody could not be told which player was steering.

### The arena itself, `web/edge/World.qml`

One of it, for as long as the edge runs. `pragma Singleton` is what says so, and every
Source the edge owns reaches it as `World`. It has no `Caller`, so it decides nothing
about who may do what; it is handed a player and told to act.

```qml
pragma Singleton                      // one instance for the whole edge

import QtQuick
import SynQt

Item {
    id: world

    // Tuning
    readonly property real size: 4000         // the arena is size x size units
    readonly property real startMass: 10      // everyone spawns this small
    readonly property int  pelletCount: 250   // food on the map at once

    // How fast a blob of a given mass moves, units per second: bigger is slower, the
    // classic trade-off. This is the ONLY thing that sets speed, and it lives here on
    // the owner, so no client can move faster than its size allows.
    function speedFor(mass) { return 260 / Math.pow(mass, 0.22) }
    // A blob's radius grows with the square root of its mass, so area tracks mass.
    function radiusFor(mass) { return 6 + Math.sqrt(mass) * 3 }
    function randPos() { return Math.random() * world.size }

    signal eaten(string prey, string predator)

    // State the browser never sees
    // Per player, keyed by GitHub sub. tx/ty is the aim point; only the model's
    // declared roles (id, name, x, y, mass, online) ever cross to a browser.
    property var roster: ({})
    property var pellets: []           // [{ id, x, y }, ...]
    property int pelletsVersion: 0     // bumped when a pellet moves; Sources watch it

    Component.onCompleted: {
        for (let i = 0; i < world.pelletCount; i++)
            world.pellets.push({ id: "p" + i, x: world.randPos(), y: world.randPos() })
    }

    // What a browser may see. These return values; they push nothing. Publishing is
    // the Source's job, and the Source is per player.
    function blobs() {
        const rows = []
        for (const sub in world.roster) {
            const b = world.roster[sub]
            if (!b.online) continue
            rows.push({ id: b.id, name: b.name, x: b.x, y: b.y,
                        mass: b.mass, online: b.online })
        }
        return rows
    }

    // The live leaderboard is its own small list: the biggest blobs by name and size.
    // It is separate from `blobs` on purpose, because in the last part the edge stops
    // sending every blob to every player, but the scoreboard must stay global. Keeping
    // it apart now means the client never has to change.
    function board() {
        return world.blobs().map(r => ({ name: r.name, mass: r.mass }))
                    .sort((a, b) => b.mass - a.mass).slice(0, 8)
    }

    function pelletRows() {
        return world.pellets.map(p => ({ id: p.id, x: p.x, y: p.y }))
    }

    // Requests, already authorized. `sub` and `name` come from the Source's verified
    // caller, never from anything a browser sent: this file has no caller of its own,
    // which is exactly why the checking happens one file over.

### One player's view of it, `web/edge/Arena.qml`

The connect point Source, one per browser session. It is where the caller arrives, so it
is where the rules are: only an approved player may steer, and the name stamped on a blob
comes from `Caller.identity`, never from an argument. Then it publishes what the world
holds.

```qml
import QtQuick
import SynQt

Arena {
    id: arena

    // The pellet field is republished only when it actually moved, and the version this
    // session last sent is this session's own business: a flag on the world would be
    // cleared by whichever browser ticked first and the rest would never see the change.
    property int lastPellets: -1

    Component.onCompleted: World.eaten.connect((prey, predator) => arena.eaten(prey, predator))

    function steer(x, y) {
        if (!Caller.hasScope("player")) return          // approved players only
        World.steer(Caller.identity.sub, Caller.identity.login, x, y)
    }

    // A cheap round trip the browser uses to show latency, and a keepalive.
    function ping() {
        if (Caller.hasScope("player")) World.keepAlive(Caller.identity.sub)
        return Date.now()
    }

    // Push the world to this browser, twenty times a second.
    Timer {
        interval: 50; repeat: true; running: true
        onTriggered: {
            arena.setBlobs(World.blobs())
            arena.setBoard(World.board())
            if (arena.lastPellets !== World.pelletsVersion) {
                arena.lastPellets = World.pelletsVersion
                arena.setPellets(World.pelletRows())
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Wire the connect point in `synqt.yaml`:

```yaml
connect_points:
  - name: arena
    owner: edge               # the edge holds the one real arena
    consumers: [app]          # the browser mirrors it
    server: web/edge/Arena.qml
    scope: player             # only approved players get the arena at all
    # no instance: a browser-facing point is per_session, which is what puts a Caller in
    # the slots above. The arena itself is shared because World.qml is.
```

`scope: player` is doing real work: a signed in visitor who is not on the guest list
never has `arena` acquired for them, so they cannot call `steer` or even see the
roster. The gate is the connect point, not the UI.

## Why this movement is honest

The auction refused a bid that did not beat the standing one; a naive game would
refuse a *position* that moved too far. But you never gave the client a position to
send. The edge takes an aim point and integrates the blob's motion itself, one tick
at a time, at `speedFor(mass)` units per second:

- A client that spams `steer` with a far corner does not jump there; it crawls there
  at its size's speed, one tick's budget at a time.
- A client that stops calling `steer` simply keeps its last goal, then goes stale and
  drops after five seconds.
- A client cannot grow without eating, cannot eat a blob its own size or larger, and
  cannot claim a name, because mass and identity are the edge's, not arguments.

There is nothing to reconcile and no correction to send back, because the client was
never the authority on where it is. The client asks for a direction to lean, and the
edge decides everything that follows from it.
