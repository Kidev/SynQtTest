# Testing your app

A connect point's slot is where authorization lives. It is the piece of an application
most worth a test and the piece hardest to check by clicking around, because the
interesting cases are the ones the UI does not offer: the bid that is too low, the caller
who is signed out, the entity that is not the edge.

So SynQt tests slots the way you write them, in QML. A test file names the Source it
drives and says who is calling; `synqt test` builds and runs it. There is no C++, no
database to start, no certificates to issue, and no browser.

```cli
synqt test
```

## The shape of a test

Tests live in `tests/`, one file per thing under test, named `tst_<Something>.qml`. Qt
Quick Test finds them by directory, so adding a file needs no registration anywhere.

Given this edge Source:

```qml
// web/edge/Edge.qml
import SynQt

Edge {
    id: auction

    highBid: 100

    // Exported as `<user> slot placeBid(int amount)`, so a signed-out caller does not
    // have the member and never reaches this function.
    function placeBid(amount) {
        if (amount <= auction.highBid) {
            Caller.emitBidRejected("Bid must beat " + auction.highBid + ".");
            return;
        }
        auction.highBid = amount;
    }
}
```

the test is:

```qml
// tests/tst_Auction.qml
import QtQuick
import QtTest
import SynQt.Test

TestCase {
    name: "Auction"

    EntityTest {
        id: harness

        source: "../web/edge/Edge.qml"
    }

    SignalSpy {
        id: rejections

        target: harness.subject
        signalName: "bidRejected"
    }

    // A fresh Source per test function, so no test passes because of the order it ran in.
    function init() {
        verify(harness.load(), harness.errorString);
        rejections.clear();
    }

    // The gate is the framework's, and this is what proves it is really there: the call
    // is made exactly as a browser console would make it, and nothing moves.
    function test_a_signed_out_visitor_cannot_bid() {
        harness.callerIsUser("anonymous");
        harness.subject.placeBid(500);
        compare(harness.subject.highBid, 100);
        compare(rejections.count, 0);
    }

    function test_a_lower_bid_is_refused() {
        harness.callerIsUser("user", { sub: "alice" });
        harness.subject.placeBid(50);
        compare(harness.subject.highBid, 100);
    }

    function test_a_higher_bid_stands() {
        harness.callerIsUser("user", { sub: "alice" });
        harness.subject.placeBid(150);
        compare(harness.subject.highBid, 150);
    }
}
```

`TestCase`, `SignalSpy`, `compare` and `verify` are [Qt Quick
Test](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtquicktest-index.html) and behave exactly as they do
anywhere else. The only SynQt-specific type is `EntityTest`.

## `EntityTest`

| Member | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `source` | the Source QML to drive, as a path relative to the test file. |
| `schema` | an SQL schema to apply to the in-memory database before each load. Relative to the test file, and usually `"../db/relational/books/schema.sql"`. |
| `subject` | the loaded Source. `null` until `load()` succeeds. This is what a test calls slots on and reads properties from. |
| `contract` | the contract name, derived from the Source type. Set it only if the derivation is wrong. |
| `errorString` | why the last `load()` failed. Pass it as the second argument to `verify` and a broken QML file reports itself. |
| `load()` | build the Source afresh and reset the in-memory engines. Call it from `init()`. Returns false rather than throwing. |
| `callerIsUser(scope, identity?)` | the next call comes from a browser user with that scope. `identity` is the normalized identity object (`sub`, `login`, `name`, `email`); omit it for an anonymous visitor. |
| `callerIsEntity(name, verified?)` | the next call comes from another entity. `verified` defaults to true; pass false to stand in for an opt-in `transport: local` link, where the name is trusted by colocation. |
| `callerIsNobody()` | no caller at all, as when the owner mutates its own state on a timer. |
| `setScopeOrder(order, hierarchical?)` | the project's scope vocabulary. Defaults to `["anonymous", "user", "moderator", "admin"]`, hierarchical, which is what `synqt new` writes. |
| `dbQuery(sql, params?)` | read the in-memory database directly, to assert on what a slot wrote rather than on what it returned. |
| `cacheValue(key)` | read the in-memory cache directly. |
| `recorded()` | what the entity recorded while this test ran, oldest first. One object per event, carrying `severity` and `category` as numbers, `severityName` and `categoryName` as the words, plus `message` and `attributes`. Drained on every `load()`. |

## What is real and what is substituted

The line between the two is what a test here can be trusted to prove.

**Real**: the Source, compiled from your QML through the same generated
`<Owner>Source` type the entity uses. `Caller`, minted through the same factory the
mesh and the web edge mint it through, including the typed `emit<Signal>` methods and
hierarchical `hasScope`. The entity type helpers, `Db`, `Cache`, `Docs` and `Jobs`, are the
same classes an entity gets, and so is `Log`, which every entity has.

**Substituted**: only the engine behind a helper. `Db` runs on SQLite in memory, `Cache`
and `Docs` on the memory providers. Nothing else is faked, and there is no test-only
door in `Caller` for the harness to use: it reaches it the same way a transport does.

### Asserting on what an entity said

`Log.info("bid accepted", { amount: amount })` in an entity's QML is a fact about how it
behaves, so `recorded()` hands it back:

```qml
    function test_an_accepted_bid_is_recorded() {
        harness.callerIsUser("user", { sub: "alice" });
        harness.subject.placeBid(150, "alice");

        const said = harness.recorded().filter(event => event.message === "bid accepted");
        compare(said.length, 1);
        compare(said[0].attributes.amount, 150);
        compare(said[0].categoryName, "application");
    }
```

The list is the real pipeline's, drained on every `load()`, so one test never reads what an
earlier one said. It holds the framework's own events too, which is why the example filters
rather than counting: a signed-in caller means a session, and a session being created is
something the framework records.

The consequence worth relying on: a slot cannot pass here and fail in production because
the test stubbed the authorization. It can still fail for a reason the harness does not
model, and there are four:

- **The transport.** The harness calls slots directly, so nothing here proves a contract
  replicates, a model reaches a browser, or a link comes up. Those are the framework's
  own guarantees, tested in SynQt's suite, not yours.
- **The topology.** Whether an entity is even allowed to reach a connect point is decided
  by the consumer allowlist, not by a slot, and `synqt check` is what answers it.
- **The engine.** A statement that works on SQLite may not on PostgreSQL. Testing the
  slot's logic is not testing your SQL against the engine you deploy.
- **The entity next door.** One Source is loaded on its own, so the accessors for
  consumed entities are absent. A slot that calls `Books.recordWinner(...)`
  fails with `Books is not defined`.

The accessor is absent rather than stubbed for a reason. A stub would have to invent what
the other entity returns, and a test that passes against an invented answer is worse than
no test. So the harness stays out of
it and the missing name reports itself. What to do instead: test the callee's slot in its
own file, where its rules are real, and leave the call between them to `synqt check` (which
decides whether it is allowed at all) and to a running system.

Split a slot that both decides and delegates, and both halves become testable:

```qml
function closeLot(nextItem) {
    if (!Caller.hasScope("admin")) {          // testable here
        Caller.emitBidRejected("Only the auctioneer can close a lot.");
        return;
    }
    Books.recordWinner(...);           // not testable here
}
```

A test that drives `closeLot` as an under-scoped caller never reaches the second half and
passes. One that drives it as an admin does reach it, and needs the branch left out of the
test, or the slot split so the decision is a function of its own.

## Running them

`synqt test` builds the test target and runs it under CTest. The project has to have been
built once first, because that is what configures the build directory; run `synqt test`
against a project that never has been and it says so rather than reporting a passing run
over nothing.

```text
$ synqt test
Test project /home/you/gavel/build/host
    Start 1: app-tests
1/1 Test #1: app-tests ........................   Passed    0.06 sec

100% tests passed out of 1
```

Run one file or one function during development by invoking the binary, which takes the
usual Qt Test arguments:

```cli
./build/host/app_tests -platform offscreen Auction::test_a_lower_bid_is_refused
```

A project with no `tests/tst_*.qml` has nothing to run, and `synqt test` says so rather
than reporting a passing run over zero tests.

## Testing an entity that is not the edge

Nothing changes. A database Source authorizes an entity rather than a person, so the test
says which entity is calling:

```qml
function test_only_the_edge_may_record() {
    harness.callerIsEntity("rogue");
    compare(harness.subject.recordWinner("vase", "bob", 300), false);
    compare(harness.dbQuery("SELECT * FROM winners").length, 0);

    harness.callerIsEntity("edge");
    compare(harness.subject.recordWinner("vase", "bob", 300), true);
    compare(harness.dbQuery("SELECT * FROM winners").length, 1);
}
```

A slot backed by `Db` needs its tables, so point `schema` at the same file the entity
applies:

```qml
EntityTest {
    id: harness

    source: "../db/relational/books/Books.qml"
    schema: "../db/relational/books/schema.sql"
}
```

Each `load()` reopens the in-memory database and reapplies the schema, so every test
function starts from an empty one.

## Where this fits

`synqt check` and `synqt test` answer different questions and neither replaces the other.
`synqt check` reads the configuration: it is what catches a client consuming a connect
point the browser cannot reach, an `env:` value that would ship to a browser, or a mesh
link that dropped mutual TLS. `synqt test` runs your code: it is what catches a slot that
forgot to check `Caller`. Both are worth having in the same command in CI.
