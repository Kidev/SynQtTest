/* The home page's "What it looks like" project.
 *
 * The section is one small system, seen the way the design editor sees it: the mesh drawn
 * across the top, a project tree of its five files under it, and beside the tree the one
 * file being read. Every part of the drawing has a file behind it: one QML file per
 * entity, and the configuration behind each contract mark, since what crosses a link is
 * written there. Pointing at a file in either the tree or the drawing opens it, and lights
 * it in the other, so the two are one set of triggers over the same five files.
 * A file stays until another is pointed at, so the reader can move the pointer into the
 * file and read it. The configuration is shown to begin with, since it is what the rest is
 * generated from.
 *
 * This script is the whole of that behavior, plus the glossary. Each file in
 * docs/index.md is followed by a hidden list whose entries name a fragment of it and say
 * what that line does. This wraps every line of the highlighted code in its own element,
 * hands each gloss to the first line that contains its fragment, and shows the text
 * under the file while that line is hovered. It reads the fragments rather than line
 * numbers so that editing a snippet does not silently shift every explanation in it by
 * one. A gloss that also carries a `data-href` turns its line into a link to the page
 * that documents it, which is where the section hands the reader on: to the class in the
 * C++ reference for a runtime accessor, or to the framework page that covers the idea
 * for everything else.
 *
 * Everything is rebuilt on each page change through Material's `document$` observable.
