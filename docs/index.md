<div class="synqt-headline" markdown>
Build complete web systems with QML, with no third party servers to stand up.
</div>

SynQt (pronounced synced) is built from entities: a browser client, a web
edge, a database, and whatever else your system needs, each its own binary,
sharing one toolchain and one security model.

## Why SynQt

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-language-markdown: __One language, front to back__

    Write the UI and the server side logic in QML. The boundary between any two
    components is a set of typed connect points, named and access controlled by
    configuration.

-   :material-flash: __Live by default__

    A value that updates across every browser the instant it changes, with no
    manual wiring and no client side polling, is a few lines of QML.

-   :material-database: __Batteries included, no third party servers__

    Add a database, cache, document store, gateway, or jobs runner as a first party
    entity. Back it with an embedded engine, or mask PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Redis
    behind it with one config value.

-   :material-devices: __Web and desktop, one codebase__

    The client is a Qt app. Ship it to the browser as WebAssembly and, from the same
    QML, as a native app for Windows, macOS, and Linux, against the same edge and the
    same security model.

-   :material-shield-lock: __Secure at every link__

    Every link is encrypted and authenticated from the first build. There is no
    plaintext connection type to reach for by mistake, only the one every entity
    already speaks.

-   :material-radar: __One click, one trace__

    Add a monitor and every entity reports to it, so a click in the browser becomes one
    trace running through each entity it touched. Nothing is recorded until you add one,
    and turning a category up during an incident is a restart, not a rebuild.

## A closer look

<div class="synqt-deepdive" markdown>

<div class="synqt-deepdive__item" markdown>

### Contracts and connect points

Two entities talk through a connect point: a named, typed, live object one entity
owns and the others see a live copy of. Properties and signals flow from the owner
out to every consumer; slots flow the other way, and the owner always decides.

[Read the programming model&nbsp;&rarr;](programming-model.md)

</div>

<div class="synqt-deepdive__item" markdown>

### Security by default

TLS everywhere, mutual TLS between entities, a deny by default topology, and data
minimization built into the contract format itself. There is no insecure middle
state a project can accidentally ship in.

[Read the security model&nbsp;&rarr;](security.md)

</div>

<div class="synqt-deepdive__item" markdown>

### One toolchain

The `synqt` CLI installs and pins the exact Qt and Emscripten versions your project
needs, builds every entity, native and WebAssembly alike, and runs them all
together with file watching and hot reload.

## What it looks like

A chat room, because everyone already knows what one does. Somebody types a line and it
appears in every window that has the room open, including the ones on other machines.
That is the part SynQt is for, and below is all of it.

A finished system is a small mesh of entities. The drawing below is that mesh, drawn by the
design editor from this very project: three boxes saying which side of the wire each entity
is on, a shape per entity, and on every line the contract the two ends share. Only the web
edge faces the internet; everything else sits in the mesh box and is reachable only by the
entities you allow.

A visitor who has signed in as nobody gets a sign-in page, and the room is absent rather
than hidden: the point that carries it is gated `scope: user`, so their session never
acquires it and there is nothing on their side to get past. Signing in fills the same
window with the room. A moderator gets one member more than everybody else, `erase`, and
gets it because the contract says so and not because the client decided to offer it.

Seven files are the whole system: one configuration file, which says what crosses each link,
one QML file per entity, two more the client's window opens, and the table the database keeps
the messages in. Hover (or focus)
an entity to read the file it is, or the mark on a line to read the block that says what
crosses it, and the card that opens says the rest. The project tree under the drawing opens
the same files, and one stays open until you move to another. The database opens two, its
QML and the table that QML queries, since neither says much without the other. The files
carry no explanatory comments: a line with something to say about itself is marked down its
left instead, and hovering it says the thing. A line that ends in an arrow opens the page
covering it, whether that is a page of this guide or the class in the C++ reference.

The button under it opens this same drawing in the
[online designer](visual-editor.md), which runs in the browser with nothing installed. It is
the same code that drew it here, so nothing is lost on the way: pull the mesh apart there,
add an entity, and export the result as a project.

<div class="synqt-explorer">

<div class="synqt-mesh">

<div class="synqt-flow">
<!-- Drawn by the design editor's own code, from the same project the editor opens at
     /designer/#example=demo: docs/javascripts/home-flow.js imports /designer/canvas.js,
     reads the document out of /designer/examples.json and hands the two to `draw`. It used
     to be a hand-drawn SVG with a ball travelling round it, which was a second picture of
     the same system, kept by hand, and it drifted the first time the demo changed.

     `data-files` is the one thing this page adds: which file each part of the drawing
     opens. It is written here rather than in the script because it names the files below,
     and the drawing's own names (an entity, a connect point) are what it keys on. -->

## Where to go next

- [Getting started](getting-started.md): install `synqt` and run your first
  project.
- [Framework](architecture.md): the full reference, from the entity model to the
  security design.
- [Examples](examples.md): complete worked systems.
- [Contributing](development.md): the codebase map, for working on SynQt itself.
- [C++ reference](api.md): the generated class and member reference for the
  runtime.
