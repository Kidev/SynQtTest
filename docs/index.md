<p class="synqt-eyebrow">QML / one toolchain / zero third party servers</p>

<div class="synqt-headline" markdown>
Build complete web systems with QML, with no third party servers to stand up.
</div>

SynQt (pronounced synced) is built from entities: a browser client, a web
edge, a database, and whatever else your system needs, each its own binary,
sharing one toolchain and one security model.

## Why SynQt

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-language-markdown: __One language, front to back__

    Write the UI and the server side logic in QML. The boundary between any two
    components is a set of typed connect points, named and access controlled by
    configuration.

-   :material-flash: __Live by default__

    A value that updates across every browser the instant it changes, with no
    manual wiring and no client side polling, is a few lines of QML.

-   :material-database: __Batteries included, no third party servers__

    Add a database, cache, document store, gateway, or jobs runner as a first party
    entity. Back it with an embedded engine, or mask PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Redis
    behind it with one config value.

-   :material-devices: __Web and desktop, one codebase__

    The client is a Qt app. Ship it to the browser as WebAssembly and, from the same
    QML, as a native app for Windows, macOS, and Linux, against the same edge and the
    same security model.

-   :material-shield-lock: __Secure at every link__

    Every link is encrypted and authenticated from the first build. There is no
    plaintext connection type to reach for by mistake, only the one every entity
    already speaks.

-   :material-radar: __One click, one trace__

    Add a monitor and every entity reports to it, so a click in the browser becomes one
    trace running through each entity it touched. Nothing is recorded until you add one,
    and turning a category up during an incident is a restart, not a rebuild.

## A closer look

<div class="synqt-deepdive" markdown>

<div class="synqt-deepdive__item" markdown>

### Contracts and connect points

Two entities talk through a connect point: a named, typed, live object one entity
owns and the others see a live copy of. Properties and signals flow from the owner
out to every consumer; slots flow the other way, and the owner always decides.

[Read the programming model&nbsp;&rarr;](programming-model.md)

</div>

<div class="synqt-deepdive__item" markdown>

### Security by default

TLS everywhere, mutual TLS between entities, a deny by default topology, and data
minimization built into the contract format itself. There is no insecure middle
state a project can accidentally ship in.

[Read the security model&nbsp;&rarr;](security.md)

</div>

<div class="synqt-deepdive__item" markdown>

### One toolchain

The `synqt` CLI installs and pins the exact Qt and Emscripten versions your project
needs, builds every entity, native and WebAssembly alike, and runs them all
together with file watching and hot reload.

## What it looks like

A finished system is a small mesh of entities. Only the web edge faces the
internet; everything else is private and reachable only by the entities you
allow. Here an anonymous visitor is served a sign-in page and nothing else, a
signed-in reader is served the app, and the app's request goes to the web edge,
which asks the database whether that caller is allowed and then reads the rows
out of the cache. Nobody's page ever waits on the third party: a jobs entity
fetches from it on its own clock, through the one entity with a route off the
machine, and puts the answer in that cache. A monitor keeps the record of all
of it.

That is eight entities and nine files: one configuration file, which says what
crosses each link, one QML file per entity, and the table the database keeps its
rows in. Hover (or focus) any part of the diagram to read the file behind it, or
pick the file out of the project tree beside it; it stays open until you move to
another one. The database opens two, its QML and the table that QML queries,
since neither says much without the other, and a directory in the tree opens
everything in it. Hover any line of a file to see what that line does, and a
line that ends in an arrow opens the page covering it, whether that is a page of
this guide or the class in the C++ reference.

The monitor is drawn apart from the mesh on purpose. Nothing links to it here
because nothing links to it in the configuration either: the one
`monitoring.entity` line is what makes every other entity report, and the links
that carries are derived rather than declared. It is also the one entity with no
QML of its own. What it does is the framework's, down to the connect point it
owns, so the scaffolder writes the rest: an operator console, and the `signin/`
page an anonymous visitor is handed instead of it.

The button under the tree opens this same system in the
[online designer](visual-editor.md), which runs in the browser with nothing
installed. Pull the mesh apart there, add an entity, and download the result as a
project.

<li data-code="qt_version" data-href="build-system-and-cli/">One version pins the whole toolchain: Qt, the Emscripten it is built against, and every entity built from them.</li>
<li data-code="order: [anonymous" data-href="security/">The scope ladder. Every session sits on one rung, and a connect point can demand a minimum.</li>
<li data-code="name: gate" data-href="security/">A second client, and the only one an anonymous visitor is ever sent. It consumes nothing, so there is nothing on it to attack.</li>
<li data-code="name: app" data-href="desktop/">The reader's client, built to WebAssembly. The same QML also builds as a native app for Windows, macOS, and Linux, against this same edge.</li>
<li data-code="type: web_edge" data-href="entities/">The one entity allowed to face the internet, on the one public port. Nothing else gets one.</li>
<li data-code="bundles: { anonymous: gate" data-href="security/">The delivery gate. A visitor is served the bundle their scope maps to and no file of any other, so the reader's app is not on an anonymous visitor's disk at all: not a redirect, not a 403, simply not there.</li>
<li data-code="type: relational" data-href="providers/">A database entity: embedded SQLite by default, PostgreSQL or MySQL behind the same interface with one config value.</li>
<li data-code="type: cache" data-href="providers/">A bounded store that forgets. In-process memory by default, Redis behind the same interface. A miss here is normal, and answering one is what keeps a reader's page off somebody else's server.</li>
<li data-code="type: api" data-href="entities/">The only entity with a route off this machine, holding the credentials for it. Calling out is granted by network:, which any entity may carry, so this is the folder and the scaffold rather than the permission.</li>
<li data-code="type: jobs" data-href="entities/">Work on a clock, with nothing listening on a port. Nobody is waiting while it runs, which is the whole reason the upstream fetch lives here.</li>
<li data-code="type: monitor" data-href="monitoring/">The operations record. One line wires it: every other entity reports to the entity monitoring.entity names, so nothing here draws a link to it.</li>
<li data-code="consumers: [app]" data-href="project-layout-and-config/">The browser's one way in, and deny by default: an entity that is not on this list cannot open this connect point at all.</li>
<li data-code="consumers: [edge, feeds]" data-href="entities/">Two consumers on one point: the edge reads the rows and the api entity writes them. Neither can reach the other, and the browser can reach neither.</li>
<li data-code="export: |" data-href="programming-model/">What may cross the link, and the whole of it. The owner names the type it exports: `edge` exports `Edge`, which is what both sides compile against.</li>
<li data-code="prop bool loaded" data-href="programming-model/">Owner to consumers, pushed. A consumer sees it change; it cannot set it.</li>
<li data-code="model rows(int id, string[120] title)" data-href="programming-model/">The roles listed here are the whole of what a row is allowed to carry to a browser, and the owner enforces the 120 at the boundary.</li>
<li data-code="slot load()" data-href="programming-model/">Consumer to owner: the one direction a request travels.</li>
<li data-code="signal denied(string[120] reason)" data-href="programming-model/">The owner's answer when it refuses, addressed to the caller that asked.</li>
<li data-code="slot bool allows" data-href="programming-model/">A slot with a return type. The caller gets a promise, so the edge can wait on the answer without blocking anything else it is serving.</li>
<li data-code="slot pull()" data-href="programming-model/">No return type, so nothing waits on it: the job asks, and the answer arrives in the cache whenever the third party gets round to it.</li>

## Where to go next

- [Getting started](getting-started.md): install `synqt` and run your first
  project.
- [Framework](architecture.md): the full reference, from the entity model to the
  security design.
- [Examples](examples.md): complete worked systems.
- [Contributing](development.md): the codebase map, for working on SynQt itself.
- [C++ reference](api.md): the generated class and member reference for the
  runtime.
